# Analytics and Modeling

Consultants are expected to be quantitatively fluent—able to work with numbers quickly, build clean models, and extract insights from data. This chapter covers the core analytical skills you'll need.

## Excel Fluency

Excel remains the workhorse of consulting analytics. While AI tools are increasingly useful for data analysis, you still need to be fast and accurate in Excel.

### Essential Excel Skills

**Navigation & Shortcuts:**

| Action | Windows | Mac |
|--------|---------|-----|
| Navigate to edge of data | Ctrl + Arrow | Cmd + Arrow |
| Select to edge of data | Ctrl + Shift + Arrow | Cmd + Shift + Arrow |
| Copy/Paste | Ctrl + C/V | Cmd + C/V |
| Paste Values | Ctrl + Alt + V, V | Cmd + Shift + V |
| Insert row/column | Ctrl + Shift + + | Cmd + Shift + + |
| Delete row/column | Ctrl + - | Cmd + - |
| Find | Ctrl + F | Cmd + F |
| Go to cell | Ctrl + G | Cmd + G |

**Key Functions:**

| Function | Use Case |
|----------|----------|
| `SUMIF` / `SUMIFS` | Conditional sums (e.g., sum revenue by region) |
| `COUNTIF` / `COUNTIFS` | Conditional counts |
| `XLOOKUP` | Look up values in a table |
| `INDEX` / `MATCH` | Flexible lookups |
| `PIVOT TABLES` | Summarize and analyze large datasets |
| `IF` / `IFS` | Conditional logic |
| `ROUND` | Clean up calculations for presentation |

### Model Design Principles

A well-designed model is:

1. **Clear** – Easy to follow, with labeled sections and consistent formatting
2. **Flexible** – Inputs separated from calculations so you can run scenarios
3. **Auditable** – Someone else can follow your logic without explanation
4. **Accurate** – Check your work; errors in models can be career-ending

**Standard Model Layout:**

```
Section 1: Inputs (blue font for hardcoded inputs)
Section 2: Calculations (black font for formulas)
Section 3: Outputs (formatted for presentation)
```

### Data Hygiene

Before analyzing data:

- **Check for errors** – Blanks, #N/A, outliers
- **Understand the source** – Where did this data come from? How was it collected?
- **Verify totals** – Do row totals match expected totals?
- **Watch for duplicates** – Use `UNIQUE` or pivot tables to check
- **Document assumptions** – What are you assuming about missing or ambiguous data?

## Market Sizing (Estimation)

Market sizing is a core consulting skill—and a staple of case interviews. It tests your ability to structure a problem, make reasonable assumptions, and do quick math.

### The Estimation Framework

1. **Clarify what you're sizing** – Be specific about geography, time period, units
2. **Choose an approach** – Top-down or bottom-up
3. **Break it into components** – MECE drivers
4. **Make assumptions** – Transparent, reasonable, defensible
5. **Calculate** – Clean math, round appropriately
6. **Sanity check** – Does the answer seem reasonable?

### Top-Down vs. Bottom-Up

**Top-down:** Start with a large known number and narrow down

> Example: US smartphone market size
> - US population: 330M
> - % with smartphones: ~85% = 280M
> - Average phone cost: $600
> - Replace every 3 years → 93M phones/year
> - Market size: 93M × $600 = **$56B/year**

**Bottom-up:** Build up from individual transactions

> Example: Coffee shop revenue in a city
> - Number of coffee shops: 500
> - Average transactions/day: 200
> - Average ticket: $5
> - Daily revenue: 500 × 200 × $5 = $500K
> - Annual: $500K × 365 = **$183M/year**

### Estimation Tips

- **Use round numbers** – 330M not 331.4M
- **Know your anchor numbers** – US population, households, GDP, etc.
- **Segment when useful** – Different assumptions for different groups
- **Show your work** – The process matters as much as the answer
- **State assumptions explicitly** – "I'm assuming 85% smartphone penetration"

### Common Anchor Numbers

| Metric | Approximate Value |
|--------|------------------|
| US population | 330 million |
| US households | 130 million |
| US GDP | $25 trillion |
| US workforce | 160 million |
| Average household income | $75,000 |
| Average household size | 2.5 people |
| Hours in a year | 8,760 |
| Days in a year | 365 |

## Synthesizing Qualitative Data

Not all consulting data is quantitative. You'll often need to synthesize interviews, customer feedback, and research into actionable insights.

### From Interviews to Insights

After conducting interviews or reviewing qualitative data:

1. **Extract key quotes** – Pull out the most insightful statements
2. **Code themes** – Group similar points into categories
3. **Quantify where possible** – "7 of 10 customers mentioned..."
4. **Identify patterns** – What themes appear across multiple sources?
5. **Distinguish facts from opinions** – What's verifiable vs. subjective?

### Affinity Mapping

Affinity mapping organizes qualitative data into logical groups:

1. Write each insight on a sticky note (or digital equivalent)
2. Group similar insights together
3. Label each group with a theme
4. Look for patterns and outliers
5. Prioritize themes by frequency and importance

### Creating Insight Summaries

A good qualitative synthesis:

- **Leads with the headline** – "Customers consistently cite delivery speed as the #1 purchase driver"
- **Provides evidence** – "7 of 10 interviews mentioned same-day delivery unprompted"
- **Acknowledges nuance** – "However, price sensitivity varies significantly by segment"
- **Suggests implications** – "This suggests we should prioritize delivery investment over price cuts"

## Quantitative Analysis in Cases

Case interviews test your ability to work with numbers under pressure. Key skills:

### Mental Math

Practice these until they're automatic:

- **Percentages** – 15% of 200 = 30 (10% is 20, 5% is 10)
- **Fractions** – 1/8 = 12.5%, 1/6 ≈ 17%, 3/8 = 37.5%
- **Multiplication** – Break into easier parts: 45 × 12 = 45 × 10 + 45 × 2 = 540
- **Division** – Round to easy numbers first

### Breakeven Analysis

> "At what price do we break even?"
>
> Breakeven: Fixed Costs / (Price - Variable Cost per Unit)
>
> Example: FC = $1M, VC = $50/unit, Price = $150
> Breakeven = $1M / ($150 - $50) = 10,000 units

### Profitability Analysis

> Profit = Revenue - Costs
> Profit = (Price × Volume) - (Fixed Costs + Variable Costs)

Changes in profitability come from:

- Price changes
- Volume changes
- Cost changes

Always break down the problem to identify which lever is moving.

### Growth Rate Calculations

> CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate):
> CAGR = (End Value / Start Value)^(1/Years) - 1

Shortcut for rough calculations:
- 10% annual growth ≈ doubles in 7 years
- 7% annual growth ≈ doubles in 10 years

## Data Visualization

The right chart makes your insight obvious. The wrong chart buries it.

### Choosing the Right Chart

| What You're Showing | Best Chart |
|--------------------|------------|
| Comparison across categories | Horizontal bar |
| Trend over time | Line |
| Part of whole (2-5 parts) | Pie or stacked bar |
| Distribution | Histogram |
| Correlation | Scatter |
| Process or flow | Diagram |
| Geographic data | Map |

### Chart Best Practices

- **Title states the insight** – Not "Revenue by Region" but "North America drives 80% of growth"
- **Labels are readable** – 12pt minimum, no overlapping
- **Color has meaning** – Highlight what matters, gray what doesn't
- **Remove chart junk** – No 3D, no unnecessary gridlines
- **Source your data** – Small text at bottom

## Practice Exercises

1. **Market sizing:** Estimate the annual revenue of all coffee shops in your city. Show your assumptions and math.

2. **Excel modeling:** Build a simple P&L model with:
   - Revenue inputs (price, volume)
   - Cost inputs (fixed, variable per unit)
   - Automatic profit calculation
   - A scenario comparison

3. **Data synthesis:** Find 5 customer reviews of a product you use. Extract key themes and write a one-paragraph synthesis of what customers value most.
