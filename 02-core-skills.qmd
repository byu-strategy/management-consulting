## Overview

Structured problem solving is a disciplined, hypothesis‑driven approach that breaks complex business challenges into smaller, logically arranged components, guides rigorous analysis, and leads to clear, actionable recommendations. Its hallmarks are:

-   **MECE breakdown:** Decompose the issue into mutually exclusive, collectively exhaustive parts so that no root causes or solution areas are overlooked and no overlaps occur.
-   **Hypothesis orientation:** Formulate an initial “best guess” about the solution, then test and refine it through targeted data gathering and analysis.
-   **Issue‐tree logic:** Map out key questions in a top‐down tree structure—e.g., “Should profitability be increased by growing volume or improving margins?”—so that every subtree corresponds to a distinct line of inquiry.
-   **Prioritization of effort:** Focus resources on the most value‐creating branches of the tree, using simple qualitative or quantitative screening to sequence analyses.
-   **Data‐driven analysis:** Collect and synthesize both qualitative insights (e.g., stakeholder interviews) and quantitative evidence (e.g., financial modeling, market sizing) to validate or refute each hypothesis.
-   **Synthesis and storytelling:** Distill findings into a coherent narrative that links the original problem definition to an evidence‑based recommendation, supported by clear “so‑what” implications and implementation considerations.

Together, these elements ensure that consultants tackle the right problem, apply effort in the right place, and deliver solutions in a way that is both logically sound and practically executable.

## MECE thinking, issue trees, hypothesis-driven problem solving

MECE stands for Mutually Exclusive, Collectively Exhaustive. It's a principle used in structured problem-solving—especially in consulting (e.g., McKinsey)—to break down complex problems into categories or sub-problems that are:

Mutually Exclusive: No overlap—each element in a breakdown fits in only one category.
Collectively Exhaustive: No gaps—the categories together cover all possible options or components.
Example:
If you're segmenting customers, a MECE breakdown might look like:

By age: 18–25, 26–35, 36–45, 46+
These are mutually exclusive (no person falls in two buckets)
And collectively exhaustive (every customer falls in one bucket)
Why it matters:
It helps avoid double-counting or missing key elements.
It supports clear communication and logical analysis.
It forms the basis of tools like issue trees and hypothesis trees.
Consultants often use MECE to structure analyses, recommendations, and slide decks.
