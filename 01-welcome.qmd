# Welcome to Management Consulting

## Course Overview

This course is designed to do two things simultaneously:

1. **Help you land a consulting internship or job** through networking, resume building, and interview preparation
2. **Make you an effective consultant from Day 1** by teaching you the core toolkit that top firms use

These aren't separate tracks—they reinforce each other. The same structured thinking that wins case interviews is what you'll use to solve client problems. The communication skills that impress recruiters are what you'll need to present to executives.

## The Consultant's Toolkit

Everything in this course maps to eight core capabilities that define successful consultants:

| Category | What It Means |
|----------|---------------|
| **Structured Problem-Solving** | Break complex problems into solvable pieces using MECE logic, hypothesis-driven thinking, and the 80/20 principle |
| **Analytics & Modeling** | Build clean models, size markets, and synthesize data into actionable insights |
| **Clear Communication** | Use the Pyramid Principle to communicate answer-first, create executive-ready slides, and deliver crisp verbal updates |
| **Workstream Ownership** | Plan your work, execute reliably, and deliver quality on time |
| **Teamwork & Collaboration** | Manage up effectively, coordinate across workstreams, and communicate transparently |
| **Client Hands** | Build stakeholder trust, prewire recommendations, and frame difficult messages |
| **Coachability** | Seek feedback proactively, implement it immediately, and maintain a growth mindset |
| **Tolerance for Ambiguity** | Make progress with incomplete information, stay calm under uncertainty, and reframe problems when needed |

Every assignment, every class session, and every project is designed to develop one or more of these capabilities.

## AI as Your Operating System

Unlike consultants five years ago, you have access to powerful AI tools that can accelerate your learning and amplify your output. In this course, AI is not a topic—it's the operating system for applying the entire toolkit.

You will use AI to:

- Research companies and industries for your projects
- Build MECE frameworks and structure your thinking
- Draft communications and create slides
- Prepare for interviews and practice cases
- Execute every project deliverable

We'll set up your AI workflow in Week 2-3, and you'll use it continuously from then on.

## The Dual-Track Structure

### Track 1: Get the Interview, Nail the Interview

This track focuses on your recruiting success:

- **Resume building** with quantified scope and impact
- **Networking strategy** using the Trust Equation
- **Case interview mastery** through structured practice
- **Behavioral interview preparation** with the PARADE framework

You'll work with your TA pod (7-8 students per TA) throughout the semester, with regular feedback sessions, practice cases, and mock interviews.

### Track 2: Freemium Consulting Projects

This track builds your actual consulting skills through progressive company analyses:

| Project | Timing | Deliverable | Team |
|---------|--------|-------------|------|
| Company Diagnostic | Week 8 | 1-page analysis | Individual |
| Competitive Benchmark | Week 10 | 3-slide deck | Individual |
| Value-Add Hypothesis | Week 12 | 5-slide deck | Pairs |
| **Capstone Proposal** | Weeks 13-14 | 15-20 slide deck + presentation | Teams of 3 |

For each project, you'll pick companies you're interested in—potentially firms where you want to work. You'll conduct outside-in analysis and pitch value-add ideas, essentially doing "freemium consulting" that demonstrates your capabilities.

## Selecting Your Target Companies

In Week 1, you'll select 3-5 target companies for your semester projects. Consider:

- **Companies you want to work for** — your analysis becomes a recruiting asset
- **Industries you're curious about** — use this as exploration
- **Companies facing interesting strategic challenges** — more learning opportunity

Your TA will discuss your selections during your Goals Chat in Week 2.

## A Note on Imposter Syndrome {#imposter-syndrome}

If you feel like you don't belong here, or that everyone else seems more prepared than you—that's normal. Nearly every successful consultant has felt this way.

Here's what we know:

1. **Consulting firms hire potential, not perfection.** They're looking for people who can learn quickly and work hard, not people who already know everything.

2. **Structured thinking is a learnable skill.** The frameworks and techniques in this course can be mastered through deliberate practice—you don't need innate genius.

3. **Your background is an asset.** Consulting teams need diverse perspectives. Whatever unique experiences you bring—different industries, international backgrounds, unusual hobbies—these become valuable when solving client problems.

4. **Feeling uncomfortable means you're growing.** If case interviews feel hard, that's because they're supposed to be. Every consultant you admire once struggled through the same learning curve.

The goal isn't to never feel uncertain. The goal is to act effectively despite uncertainty—which is exactly what consultants do with clients every day.

## Your TA Pod

You've been assigned to a pod of 7-8 students led by one TA. This is your home base for the semester:

- **Goals Chat (Week 2)**: Establish your recruiting goals and development focus
- **Feedback Sessions (4x/semester)**: 10-minute check-ins on your progress
- **Case Practice**: Regular casing with your TA and pod members
- **Resume & Networking Support**: Detailed feedback throughout the semester

Your TA has recently navigated the same recruiting process you're entering. Lean on their experience.

## What Success Looks Like

By the end of this course, you will:

- Have a consulting-ready resume and active networking tracker
- Be confident in case interviews (having completed 8-10+ practice cases)
- Have a bank of polished behavioral stories using the PARADE framework
- Have completed four progressively complex company analyses
- Understand how to add value from Day 1 as a first-year analyst

More importantly, you'll have internalized a way of thinking—structured, hypothesis-driven, client-focused—that will serve you throughout your career, whether or not you ultimately join a consulting firm.

Let's get started.
