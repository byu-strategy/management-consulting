# AI for Consultants

AI is not a separate topic in this course—it's the operating system for everything you do. Just as consultants twenty years ago had to master Excel, you need to master AI-assisted workflows to be effective in modern consulting.

## Why AI Matters for Consultants

Consulting has always been about solving problems faster and better than clients can themselves. AI amplifies this by:

- **Accelerating research**: What took days of reading 10-Ks and industry reports now takes hours
- **Structuring thinking**: AI can help you generate MECE frameworks, issue trees, and hypotheses
- **Drafting communications**: First drafts of slides, emails, and memos can be generated in minutes
- **Analyzing data**: Pattern recognition and synthesis across large datasets becomes feasible
- **Practicing interviews**: AI can serve as a case partner or behavioral interview coach

Top consulting firms are rapidly integrating AI into their workflows. McKinsey has Lilli, BCG has tools across their practice, and Bain invests heavily in AI-augmented analytics. The consultants who thrive will be those who use AI effectively—not as a crutch, but as an amplifier of their thinking.

## Your AI Toolkit

We'll use three primary tools in this course:

### 1. VS Code or Cursor

**What it is:** A code editor that becomes your command center for AI-assisted work.

**Why we use it:** Unlike ChatGPT in a browser, working in VS Code/Cursor gives you:

- Persistent context across work sessions
- The ability to work with multiple files simultaneously
- Integration with your file system for saving and organizing work
- More sophisticated prompting through markdown files

**Setup:**

1. Download [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or [Cursor](https://cursor.sh/)
2. If using VS Code, install the Claude extension or GitHub Copilot
3. Create a folder for your STRAT 325 work

### 2. Claude (via Claude Code or Anthropic)

**What it is:** A large language model that excels at structured reasoning, analysis, and synthesis.

**Why we use it:** Claude is particularly strong for consulting work because it:

- Handles long documents and complex prompts well
- Produces structured, professional output
- Can maintain consistency across long work sessions
- Is excellent at synthesis and summarization

**Setup:**

1. Create an account at [claude.ai](https://claude.ai)
2. For power users: Consider Claude Pro ($20/month) for more capacity
3. For advanced workflows: Install Claude Code CLI for terminal-based work

### 3. Specialized Tools

Depending on your projects, you may also use:

- **Perplexity**: For research-intensive company analysis
- **Gamma or Beautiful.ai**: For rapid slide creation
- **Excel Copilot**: For spreadsheet modeling (if you have Microsoft 365)

## The AI-Assisted Consulting Workflow

Here's how AI integrates into each phase of consulting work:

### Research Phase

```
Traditional: 8+ hours reading 10-Ks, earnings calls, industry reports
AI-Assisted: 2-3 hours with AI synthesizing sources + your critical review
```

**Example prompt for company research:**

> "I'm analyzing [Company X] for a strategic analysis project. Based on their most recent 10-K, earnings calls, and industry context, help me understand:
> 1. Their current strategic position
> 2. Key competitive advantages and vulnerabilities
> 3. Major strategic challenges they're likely facing
> 4. 3-5 hypotheses about where they could improve
>
> For each point, cite specific evidence."

### Structuring Phase

```
Traditional: Whiteboard session to build MECE framework
AI-Assisted: Generate initial structure with AI, then refine and stress-test
```

**Example prompt for framework development:**

> "I'm trying to understand why [Company X's] profit margins have declined 5% over the past 3 years. Help me build a MECE issue tree that breaks down all possible drivers of this margin compression.
>
> For each branch, give me:
> - The category (mutually exclusive from others)
> - 2-3 specific hypotheses to test
> - What data I would need to validate each hypothesis"

### Analysis Phase

```
Traditional: Manual data gathering, Excel modeling, slide-by-slide creation
AI-Assisted: AI helps structure analysis, draft exhibits, and identify patterns
```

**Example prompt for data synthesis:**

> "I have the following data points from my research on [Company X]:
> [paste your notes]
>
> Help me:
> 1. Identify the 3-5 most significant insights
> 2. Structure these into a logical flow for a slide deck
> 3. Suggest what exhibit type (chart, table, diagram) would best communicate each insight"

### Communication Phase

```
Traditional: Hours drafting and refining slide decks
AI-Assisted: AI generates drafts, you edit and elevate
```

**Example prompt for slide drafting:**

> "I need to create a one-slide executive summary for my analysis of [Company X]. My key findings are:
> [list findings]
>
> Draft:
> 1. A compelling headline (action-oriented, 10 words max)
> 2. 3-4 supporting bullets (each 1 line, evidence-based)
> 3. A recommendation sentence"

## AI Principles for Consultants

### 1. AI is a Draft Generator, Not a Final Answer

Everything AI produces needs your critical review. AI can:

- Make up facts that sound plausible ("hallucinations")
- Miss nuances that domain experts would catch
- Default to generic frameworks when specific ones would be better

**Your job:** Use AI to accelerate your work, then apply your judgment to refine, verify, and elevate the output.

### 2. Prompting is a Skill

The quality of AI output depends heavily on the quality of your prompts. Good prompts:

- Provide context (who you are, what you're trying to do)
- Are specific about the output format you want
- Break complex requests into steps
- Include examples of what "good" looks like

**Example of vague vs. specific prompting:**

❌ "Analyze Apple"

✅ "I'm a sophomore preparing for consulting interviews. I need to understand Apple's competitive position in the smartphone market for a case study. Help me identify:
1. Apple's top 3 competitive advantages (with evidence)
2. Their 2 biggest strategic vulnerabilities
3. One emerging threat they should be watching

Format each point as a headline + 2-3 sentences of supporting evidence."

### 3. Maintain Your Analytical Muscles

The risk of AI dependency is atrophy of your own thinking. Balance AI use with:

- Building frameworks by hand first, then comparing to AI suggestions
- Doing mental math before reaching for calculators
- Writing first drafts yourself sometimes, especially early in the course

### 4. Firm Policies Vary

Different consulting firms have different AI policies. Some encourage extensive AI use; others restrict it, especially for client-facing work. Learn your firm's policies during your internship. For now, develop fluency so you can adapt either way.

## In-Class AI Setup Workshop

During our Week 3 session, we'll:

1. **Install and configure** your AI toolkit
2. **Practice prompting** with consulting-relevant examples
3. **Build your first AI-assisted analysis** of a target company
4. **Share and critique** outputs as a class

Come prepared with:

- Your laptop with VS Code or Cursor installed
- A Claude account (free tier is fine to start)
- One target company selected from your Week 1 list

## AI Readings

Before the Week 3 hands-on session, read:

## AI Throughout This Course

From Week 3 onward, you should use AI for every major assignment:

| Assignment | How to Use AI |
|------------|---------------|
| Company Diagnostic (P1) | Research, framework generation, draft synthesis |
| Competitive Benchmark (P2) | Data gathering, comparison structure, exhibit drafts |
| Value-Add Hypothesis (P3) | Ideation, prioritization logic, slide drafting |
| Capstone Proposal | All of the above, plus presentation prep |
| Case Practice | Generate practice cases, get feedback on frameworks |
| Behavioral Prep | Draft and refine PARADE stories |

The expectation is not that AI does your work—it's that you learn to use AI as a force multiplier for your own thinking.
