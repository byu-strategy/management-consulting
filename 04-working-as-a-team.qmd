title: "Working as a Team"
---

Before diving into consulting content, we need to establish how we'll work together. At McKinsey, every engagement begins with a "team launch"—a session where team members align on norms, roles, and working styles. We'll do the same.

## Why Teaming Matters

Consulting is fundamentally collaborative. You will:

- Work in a **pod** with your TA and 7-8 classmates all semester
- Complete your **capstone** in teams of 3
- Practice **cases** with peers throughout the course
- Give and receive **feedback** constantly

How well you team directly impacts how much you learn and how prepared you are for the job.

## Your Pod Structure

Each pod includes:

- **1 TA**: Your primary mentor, coach, and feedback-giver
- **7-8 Students**: Your learning community for the semester

Your pod is your home base for:

| Activity | Frequency |
|:---------|:----------|
| Goals chat | Week 2 |
| Feedback sessions | 4x per semester |
| Case practice | Ongoing |
| Resume review | Weeks 5-6 |
| Behavioral prep | Weeks 10-12 |

## Team Norms

### The Consulting Standard

In consulting, teams operate with high expectations:

1. **Deliver what you promise**: If you commit to something, it gets done
2. **Surface issues early**: Problems get bigger when hidden
3. **Prepare before meetings**: Come ready to contribute
4. **Give direct feedback**: Kind but honest
5. **Assume positive intent**: Teammates want to succeed

### Our Class Norms

We'll hold ourselves to the same standard:

- **Show up prepared**: Complete readings, bring your work
- **Engage actively**: Cold calling happens; be ready
- **Meet deadlines**: Late work signals unreliability
- **Support each other**: Everyone's success is good for you

## Working Styles

People work differently. Understanding your style—and your teammates' styles—reduces friction.

### Common Style Dimensions

| Dimension | Spectrum |
|:----------|:---------|
| **Communication** | Direct ↔ Diplomatic |
| **Decision-making** | Fast/intuitive ↔ Slow/analytical |
| **Work preference** | Solo focus ↔ Collaborative |
| **Feedback** | Blunt ↔ Gentle |
| **Planning** | Structured ↔ Flexible |

### Team Launch Exercise

In your pod, discuss:

1. What's your default working style?
2. What brings out your best work?
3. What frustrates you in team settings?
4. How do you prefer to receive feedback?

Document your pod's agreements and revisit them mid-semester.

## Roles on a Consulting Team

On an engagement, common roles include:

| Role | Responsibility |
|:-----|:---------------|
| **Engagement Manager (EM)** | Overall workplan, client relationship, team coordination |
| **Associate/Consultant** | Own a workstream, conduct analyses, build content |
| **Business Analyst** | Support analyses, research, model building |

In this class:

- Your **TA** is like an EM—guiding, coaching, not doing your work
- **You** are like an Associate—owning your workstream end-to-end
- On **capstone teams**, you'll rotate leadership responsibilities

## Giving and Receiving Feedback

Feedback is the engine of improvement. Consultants get feedback constantly—after every client meeting, every deliverable, every presentation.

### Giving Feedback

Use the **SBI Model**:

- **Situation**: When/where did this happen?
- **Behavior**: What specifically did you observe?
- **Impact**: What was the effect?

Example: "In our case practice yesterday (situation), you jumped to a recommendation before structuring the problem (behavior). This made it hard to follow your logic (impact)."

### Receiving Feedback

1. **Listen fully**: Don't interrupt or defend
2. **Ask clarifying questions**: "Can you give me an example?"
3. **Thank them**: Feedback is a gift
4. **Reflect**: What will you do differently?

### Feedback in This Class

| Feedback Type | Frequency | From |
|:--------------|:----------|:-----|
| Project feedback | After each submission | TA + Professor |
| Case practice feedback | Ongoing | Peers + TA |
| Resume feedback | 2x | TA |
| Behavioral feedback | As needed | TA |
| Self-reflection | Mid-semester | You |

## Managing Conflict

Teams encounter conflict. How you handle it matters.

### Healthy Conflict

- Debating the best approach to a problem
- Pushing back on weak logic
- Disagreeing about priorities

### Unhealthy Conflict

- Personal attacks
- Avoiding hard conversations
- Letting resentment build

### Resolution Approach

1. **Address it directly**: Talk to the person, not about them
2. **Focus on behavior, not character**: "You missed the deadline" not "You're unreliable"
3. **Seek to understand**: What's their perspective?
4. **Escalate if needed**: TA → Professor if unresolved

## Capstone Team Formation

In Week 12-13, you'll form capstone teams of 3. Consider:

- **Complementary skills**: Mix of strengths
- **Compatible styles**: Can you work together under pressure?
- **Shared commitment**: Equal investment in quality

More guidance will come closer to team formation.

## This Week's Action

In your pod meeting this week:

1. Introduce yourselves (background, goals, concerns)
2. Complete the working styles discussion
3. Document 3-5 pod norms you'll commit to
4. Exchange contact information

Come to class ready to share one norm your pod agreed on.
