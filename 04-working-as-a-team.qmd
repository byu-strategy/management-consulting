title: "Working as a Team"
---


Consulting is fundamentally collaborative and you work closely in team. In class you will:

- Collaborate in a **pod** with your TA and 7-8 classmates all semester
- Complete your **capstone** in sub-teams of 3-4
- Practice **cases** with peers throughout the course
- Give and receive **feedback** 

## Your Pod Structure

Each pod includes:

- **1 TA**: Your primary mentor, coach, and feedback-giver
- **7-8 Students**: Your learning community for the semester

Your pod serves three purposes:

1. **Support system**: People rooting for your success and checking in on your progress
2. **Practice interview partners**: 5 peers to practice behavioral and case interviews with
3. **Peer feedback**: Resume reviews, story refinement, and honest input

| Activity | Frequency |
|:---------|:----------|
| Goals Worksheet + Chat | Week 2 |
| TA Practice Interviews | 3x per semester (Weeks 4, 8, 13) |
| TA Mentoring Sessions | 3x per semester (Weeks 5, 9-10, 14) |
| Practice interviews with peers | 7 sessions (ongoing) |
| Resume review | Weeks 5-7 |

## Team Norms

### The Consulting Standard

In consulting, teams operate with high expectations:

1. **Deliver what you promise**: If you commit to something, it gets done
2. **Surface issues early**: Problems get bigger when hidden
3. **Prepare before meetings**: Come ready to contribute
4. **Give direct feedback**: Kind but honest
5. **Assume positive intent**: Teammates want to succeed

### Our Class Norms

We'll hold ourselves to the same standard:

- **Show up prepared**: Complete readings, bring your work
- **Engage actively**: Cold calling happens; be ready
- **Meet deadlines**: Late work signals unreliability
- **Support each other**: Everyone's success is good for you

## Working Styles

People work differently. Understanding your style, and your teammates' styles, reduces friction.

### Common Style Dimensions

| Dimension | Spectrum |
|:----------|:---------|
| **Communication** | Direct ↔ Diplomatic |
| **Decision-making** | Fast/intuitive ↔ Slow/analytical |
| **Work preference** | Solo focus ↔ Collaborative |
| **Feedback** | Blunt ↔ Gentle |
| **Planning** | Structured ↔ Flexible |

## Roles on a Consulting Team

On an engagement, common roles include:

| Role | Responsibility |
|:-----|:---------------|
| **Engagement Manager (EM)** | Overall workplan, client relationship, team coordination |
| **Associate/Consultant** | Own a workstream, conduct analyses, build content |
| **Business Analyst** | Support analyses, research, model building |

In this class:

- Your **TA** is like an EM: guiding, coaching, not doing your work
- **You** are like an Associate: owning your workstream end-to-end
- On **capstone teams**, you'll rotate leadership responsibilities

## Giving and Receiving Feedback

Feedback is the engine of improvement. Consultants get feedback frequently.

### Giving Feedback

Use the **SBI Model**:

- **Situation**: When/where did this happen?
- **Behavior**: What specifically did you observe?
- **Impact**: What was the effect?

Example: "In our case practice yesterday (situation), you jumped to a recommendation before structuring the problem (behavior). This made it hard to follow your logic (impact)."

### Receiving Feedback

1. **Listen fully**: Don't interrupt or defend
2. **Ask clarifying questions**: "Can you give me an example?"
3. **Thank them**: Feedback is a gift
4. **Reflect**: What will you do differently?

### Feedback in This Class

| Feedback Type | Frequency | From |
|:--------------|:----------|:-----|
| Project feedback | After each submission | TA |
| Practice interview feedback | After each practice interview | Peers + TA |
| Resume feedback | 2x (Weeks 5, 7) | TA |
| TA Mentoring Sessions | 3x (Weeks 5, 9-10, 14) | TA |
| Self-reflection | Mid-semester | You |

## Managing Conflict

Teams encounter conflict. How you handle it matters.

### Healthy Conflict

- Debating the best approach to a problem
- Pushing back on weak logic
- Disagreeing about priorities

### Unhealthy Conflict

- Personal attacks
- Avoiding hard conversations
- Letting resentment build

### Resolution Approach

1. **Address it directly**: Talk to the person, not about them
2. **Focus on behavior, not character**: "You missed the deadline" not "You're unreliable"
3. **Seek to understand**: What's their perspective?
4. **Escalate if needed**: TA → Professor if unresolved

## Capstone Team Formation

In Week 12-13, you'll form capstone sub-teams of 3-4. Consider:

- **Complementary skills**: Mix of strengths
- **Compatible styles**: Can you work together under pressure?
- **Shared commitment**: Equal investment in quality

More guidance will come closer to sub-team formation.
