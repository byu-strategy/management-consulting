# Project 1: Company Diagnostic

This is your first "freemium consulting" project—a quick, outside-in analysis of a target company. You'll apply the structured thinking and research skills from the first half of the course to produce a one-page diagnostic.

## Project Overview

| Element | Details |
|---------|---------|
| **Deliverable** | One-page company diagnostic |
| **Due** | Week 8 (Thursday) |
| **Format** | Individual |
| **Submission** | PDF uploaded to Learning Suite |

## What is a Company Diagnostic?

A company diagnostic is a rapid assessment of a company's strategic position. It's the type of analysis a consultant might do in the first few days of a new engagement—getting smart on the client quickly using publicly available information.

Your diagnostic should answer: **What are the 2-3 most important strategic issues this company faces?**

## The Outside-In Approach

"Outside-in" means you're analyzing the company using only public information—the same information any consultant would access before having internal client data.

### Data Sources

| Source | What You'll Learn |
|--------|------------------|
| **10-K / Annual Report** | Business model, segments, risks, financial performance |
| **Earnings Calls** | Management's priorities, recent challenges, forward outlook |
| **Investor Presentations** | Strategic initiatives, key metrics, competitive positioning |
| **Industry Reports** | Market trends, competitive landscape, growth drivers |
| **News & Press Releases** | Recent developments, announcements, executive changes |
| **Competitor Filings** | How peers are performing and positioning |

### AI-Assisted Research

Use your AI workflow to accelerate research:

> "I'm analyzing [Company X] for a strategic diagnostic. Based on their 10-K and recent earnings calls, help me identify:
> 1. Their core business model and revenue drivers
> 2. Key risks they've disclosed
> 3. Strategic initiatives they're pursuing
> 4. 2-3 potential strategic challenges
>
> Cite specific evidence for each point."

Then verify and deepen the AI's findings with your own reading.

## Diagnostic Framework

Structure your analysis around these elements:

### 1. Company Overview (Brief)

- What does the company do?
- Key business segments
- Recent financial performance (revenue, profit trends)

### 2. Competitive Position

- Where does the company stand vs. competitors?
- Key competitive advantages
- Key vulnerabilities

### 3. Strategic Challenges

- What are the 2-3 most pressing issues facing the company?
- What evidence supports these being the key issues?
- What's at stake if these aren't addressed?

### 4. So What?

- Why do these challenges matter for the company's future?
- What questions would you want to explore further?

## One-Page Format

Your deliverable is a **single page** (front only, no attachments). This constraint forces you to synthesize ruthlessly.

## Evaluation Criteria

Your diagnostic will be evaluated on:

| Criterion | Weight | Description |
|-----------|--------|-------------|
| **Insight Quality** | 40% | Are the strategic challenges genuinely important? Are they well-supported by evidence? |
| **Synthesis** | 30% | Have you distilled the key issues, not just summarized the company? |
| **Structure** | 20% | Is the page clear, scannable, and logically organized? |
| **Evidence** | 10% | Are claims backed by specific data or facts? |

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

| Mistake | How to Avoid |
|---------|--------------|
| Describing the company without insight | Focus on "so what," not just "what" |
| Too many challenges | Pick the 2-3 that matter most |
| Vague claims | Use specific numbers and evidence |
| Cluttered page | Ruthlessly edit for clarity |
| No point of view | Take a stance on what matters |

## Timeline

| When | What |
|------|------|
| Week 7 | Select your company, begin research |
| Week 8 Tuesday | Draft complete, bring for feedback |
| Week 8 Thursday | Final version due |

## Getting Started

1. **Choose a company** from your Week 1 target list (or choose a new one if your interests have changed)
2. **Gather materials** – 10-K, earnings calls, investor presentations, industry reports
3. **Use AI** to help synthesize key points
4. **Draft your framework** – What are the key buckets?
5. **Identify challenges** – What 2-3 issues stand out?
6. **Write and edit** – Get it to one page

Bring your draft to class Week 8 for peer feedback before final submission.
