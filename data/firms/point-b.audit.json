  "notes": "Point B is a well-established boutique consulting firm founded in 1995 with a unique employee ownership model (100% ESOP since 2014). The firm has strong work-life balance ratings and is backed by Endeavour private equity. They are part of the Nextcontinent global consulting network. Zero BYU alumni presence indicates this is a 'hustle' firm for BYU students. Compensation data is limited to base salary estimates from Glassdoor. The firm's distinctive culture around work-life balance and local staffing makes them different from traditional MBB/Big 4 models."
