  "notes": "Pre-populated data from CSV covered all LinkedIn/BYU fields. Firm website and careers page provided company info, founding year, and recruiting approach. Glassdoor and salary aggregators provided compensation data. Economic consulting firms like CRA typically have lower travel expectations than traditional strategy consulting firms, as work is more office/data-based. No active BYU recruiting presence identified—all Marriott alumni counts are 0, suggesting networking through general BYU alumni is the only pathway."
