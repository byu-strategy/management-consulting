  "notes": "CSV data provided all LinkedIn and BYU alumni fields successfully. Advancy has minimal BYU presence (1 alum total, 0 from Marriott), making this a 'hustle' pipeline firm. Management Consulted profile was accessed via Chrome extension due to bot protection. Firm specializes in 3 core sectors (Chemicals/Materials, Life Sciences, Consumer) with deep expertise. Low travel (~10%) is a distinctive feature. Compensation data for MBA level not available from public sources."
