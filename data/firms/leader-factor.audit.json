  "notes": "Leader Factor is a specialized leadership development and organizational culture consulting firm, not a traditional management consulting firm. Founded by Dr. Timothy R. Clark (Oxford PhD), the firm focuses exclusively on psychological safety and culture transformation. With only 24 employees and 16 BYU alumni currently employed (100% of all-time BYU alumni), it appears to be a Utah-based firm with strong local hiring patterns. The firm's website was not accessible during research (ECONNREFUSED), but LinkedIn and third-party sources provided good information about their services and client base. This is more of a training/certification/speaking business model than traditional consulting. All CSV-provided data successfully populated."
