  "notes": "Cicero Group has an exceptionally strong BYU connection with 129 total alumni (highest of any boutique firm in the dataset). Founder Randy Shumway is a BYU graduate (BS Business Management, BS Political Science), which likely contributes to the strong pipeline. The firm was acquired by MGT in September 2024, though it maintains its brand and operations. Pre-populated CSV data covered all LinkedIn and BYU alumni fields successfully. The firm's low-travel model and Salt Lake City headquarters make it particularly attractive to BYU students seeking work-life balance in consulting."
