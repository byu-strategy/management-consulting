FTI Consulting operates through five specialized segments (Corporate Finance & Restructuring, Forensic & Litigation, Economic Consulting, Technology, Strategic Communications). Firm founded in 1982 as Forensic Technologies International, went public 1996, rebranded 1998. Strong undergraduate recruiting program with multiple 2026 entry-level postings across all segments. MBA recruiting confirmed but compensation data unavailable. Work-life balance varies significantly by segment and project demands."
