  "notes": "Pre-populated data from CSV covered LinkedIn ID, employee count, and all BYU/Marriott alumni metrics. Mercer is an HR and benefits consulting firm, not a traditional strategy consultancy, which affects compensation (lower than MBB), work-life balance (better), and interview focus (HR scenarios vs. pure strategy). Strong BYU alumni network (280+ all-time) but firm does not appear to actively recruit on campus. Compensation data was more difficult to find than for MBB/Big 4 firms and reflects Mercer's specialized HR consulting focus rather than general management consulting."
