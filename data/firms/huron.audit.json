  "notes": "Pre-populated data from CSV covered LinkedIn ID, employee count, and all BYU alumni metrics. Huron does not have a Management Consulted profile page. Founded in 2002 by Arthur Andersen alumni following that firm's collapse related to the Enron scandal. Compensation data for undergraduate level was found through multiple sources (Glassdoor, Wall Street Oasis, Levels.fyi), but MBA-level compensation data was not available. The firm operates with year-round rolling applications rather than fixed recruiting cycles. Travel expectations are high (60-90% weekly to client sites) with demanding hours (40-60+ per week)."
