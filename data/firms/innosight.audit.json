  "notes": "Management Consulted profile was comprehensive with clear compensation data for MBA hires and good overview of the firm. Founded by Clayton Christensen (author of The Innovator's Dilemma) in 2000, acquired by Huron in 2017. LinkedIn showed 35 all-time BYU alumni with only 2 currently at the firm, suggesting the firm doesn't actively recruit at BYU. Glassdoor and web searches provided good interview process details including the unique group case format. No undergraduate compensation data was available—MC only listed MBA/PhD level. The firm is known for disruptive innovation theory and Jobs-to-be-Done framework."
