  "notes": "Pre-populated data from CSV covered LinkedIn/BYU fields. Booz Allen is unique among consulting firms: no case interviews, government/defense focus, security clearance required. Strong BYU alumni presence (65 current, 271 all-time) makes this an accessible firm for BYU students through alumni networking. Management Consulted profile could not be accessed directly (403 error), but supplementary sources provided compensation and recruiting details. Firm is publicly traded (not partnership structure like MBB), which affects career progression terminology (VP instead of Partner)."
