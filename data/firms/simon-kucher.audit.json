  "notes": "Pre-populated data from CSV covered LinkedIn ID (9546), employee count (2,873), and all BYU alumni metrics. Firm website and Management Consulted provided founding year, headquarters, and email format. Multiple salary aggregation sites (Glassdoor, Levels.fyi, Wall Street Oasis) provided compensation ranges. Simon-Kucher has minimal BYU presence (only 1 current alum total, 0 from Marriott), indicating students must hustle to break in. The firm is distinctive as the world's leading pricing specialist with 40 years of monetization expertise."
