Since 2000, we have had the privilege of advising and collaborating with many of the world's most extraordinary social change leaders including philanthropists, nonprofit and NGO leaders, and impact investors. We are passionate about helping social change leaders find solutions to economic and social barriers that perpetuate inequities and prevent individuals, families, and communities from having access to opportunities they need to thrive. We use rigorous research to gain insights that help our clients solve problems and achieve their goals. Our services include strategy consulting and advising, sourcing and diligence, and leadership team support. We take what we learn from this work and build on it with original research, identifying best practices and innovative ideas to share with the social sector.",
