  "notes": "Korn Ferry is distinctive as a hybrid organization combining traditional management consulting with executive search and talent acquisition. The firm's identity has evolved significantly since acquiring Hay Group in 2015. CSV data provided all LinkedIn and BYU metrics. Compensation data is less transparent than pure strategy firms, likely because the firm has multiple business lines beyond consulting. The firm appears to have limited BYU presence (8 current alumni, 0 from Marriott specifically), suggesting students would need to network through general BYU alumni rather than Marriott-specific connections."
