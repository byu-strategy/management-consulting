  "description": "As one of the original firms, we've never lost sight of the fact that consulting is a people business. A global partnership in more than 40 countries, our people make us who we are. We're individuals with different passions and strengths who take as much joy in the work we do as from those we work with. Our strategic operations heritage means we've always known that a plan is only as good as the outcome it inspires. In practice, our teams bring the perspective, understanding, and hands-on know-how to build the future as you see it. Working together we'll see big ideas through to working realities, helping you move from keeping up to breaking through. By your side, we deliver—value, results, impact.",
