  "notes": "Pre-populated CSV data provided all LinkedIn and BYU alumni fields. PwC's consulting practice is distinct from Strategy& (their pure strategy arm), which has separate recruiting and compensation. This profile focuses on PwC Consulting, not Strategy&. Undergraduate compensation estimates are based on Big 4 industry patterns. MBA compensation left null due to lack of reliable PwC Consulting-specific data (most sources conflate with Strategy& or don't distinguish between divisions). Work-life balance and travel are highly variable by project and office."
