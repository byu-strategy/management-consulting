  "notes": "Pre-populated data from CSV covered LinkedIn ID and BYU alumni counts (all zero). West Monroe has zero BYU alumni presence according to LinkedIn data, making it a 'hustle' firm for BYU students. The firm has a unique 50/50 ownership structure between MSD Partners and employees. Compensation data for undergraduate entry-level is below typical Big 4/MBB ranges. Management Consulted profile exists but has bot protection (403 error). Email format has multiple variations but most common appears to be first_initial.lastname@westmonroe.com."
