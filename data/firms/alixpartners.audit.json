  "notes": "Pre-populated data from CSV covered LinkedIn ID, BYU alumni counts, and employee count. AlixPartners is distinctive as a crisis management and restructuring specialist. The firm uses Vice President as the post-MBA entry title, which differs from traditional consulting hierarchies. Notable for extremely high travel requirements (M-F vs typical M-Th) and inclusion of psychological assessment in hiring process. Limited undergraduate compensation data available—firm appears to focus heavily on MBA and experienced hire recruiting. Acquired Galt & Company in 2021 to add strategy capabilities to their traditional restructuring focus."
