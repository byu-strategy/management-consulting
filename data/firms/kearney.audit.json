  "notes": "Complete profile successfully populated for Kearney. All required CSV data fields were present and populated. The firm has a rich history dating back to 1926 as part of McKinsey's Chicago office. Research revealed strong compensation data from Levels.fyi and multiple consulting career sites. The firm is particularly well-documented in case interview preparation resources due to its distinctive quantitative and operations-focused interview style. Notable that Marriott-specific alumni count shows 0 in CSV while general BYU has 84 all-time alumni, suggesting the alumni may have attended other BYU colleges. Kearney rebranded from A.T. Kearney to just 'Kearney' in January 2020."
