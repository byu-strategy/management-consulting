  "description": "In 2020, Altman Vilandrie & Company and Solon Management Consulting have cemented a decades-long partnership across the Atlantic to form Altman Solon, the world's largest global strategy consulting firm with an exclusive focus on the TMT sector. Our consultants are united by our passion and intellectual curiosity for the Telecommunications, Media, and Technology (TMT) sectors. These sectors, representing a $5+ trillion global market, are defined by remarkable technological innovations, business model disruptions, rapidly shifting consumer demands, shrinking barriers to entry, and confusing regulatory changes – challenges that Altman Solon is prepared for and eager to address on behalf of our clients. As trusted advisors to major industry players and leading investors, we have helped to identify, develop, and implement many of the era-defining strategies that have shaped the TMT sector over the last twenty years. Altman Solon has an extensive international reach with offices in Amsterdam, Boston, London, Los Angeles, Mexico City, Milan, Munich, New York, Paris, Riyadh, San Francisco, Singapore, Stockholm, Sydney, Warsaw, and Zurich, with successful projects completed across the globe in more than 100 countries.",
