  "notes": "Pre-populated data from CSV covered LinkedIn/BYU fields. Management Consulted provided comprehensive information on recruiting process, culture, career path, and compensation. DeciBio requires life sciences degree for all consulting positions. Firm has zero BYU alumni historically, making it a 'hustle' pipeline requiring significant networking. Founded in 2009 as DeciBio LLC, became DeciBio Consulting in 2013. Strong focus on work-life balance compared to other consulting firms. Highly selective with <1% offer rate."
