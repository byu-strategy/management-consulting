  "notes": "A&M CRG is a relatively new division (2019) of the larger Alvarez & Marsal firm. Pre-populated CSV data covered LinkedIn/BYU fields. Most company information came from firm website. Compensation data extrapolated from parent company A&M salary data and industry comparables. No BYU alumni presence means this is a 'hustle' firm for BYU students requiring cold outreach. Management Consulted profile exists for parent company but not specific A&M CRG division."
