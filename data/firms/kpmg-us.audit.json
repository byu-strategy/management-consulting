  "notes": "Pre-populated data from CSV covered LinkedIn ID, employee count, and all BYU alumni metrics. KPMG does not have a Management Consulted firm profile page, so compensation data was gathered from Glassdoor, Levels.fyi, and salary aggregators. Interview process details from Management Consulted's general KPMG interview guide. Founded year uses original US founding (1897) rather than modern KPMG merger date (1987). KPMG Advisory is part of KPMG US, one of the Big 4 accounting firms, distinguished by its industry-aligned structure."
