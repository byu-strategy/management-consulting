Credera was acquired by Omnicom in 2018, giving it unique positioning as a consultancy embedded within a marketing/advertising conglomerate. Management Consulted profile exists but was inaccessible due to bot protection (403 error). Company emphasizes work-life balance and cultural fit more than traditional consulting firms. Strong Marriott alumni representation (8 of 13 current BYU alumni are from Marriott). Compensation data limited to entry-level base salary estimate from Glassdoor; specific bonus structures not publicly available."
