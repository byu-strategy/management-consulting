  "notes": "Pre-populated data from CSV covered LinkedIn ID (65683578) and BYU alumni fields (all zero). Firm formed in 2020 from merger of two predecessor firms. The 'founded' date of 2020 reflects the merged entity, though Altman Vilandrie dates to 2002 and Solon to 1996. TMT-exclusive focus is a major differentiator. No current BYU alumni presence makes this a 'hustle' pipeline for BYU students."
