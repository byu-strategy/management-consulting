  "notes": "Guidehouse is a young firm (founded 2018) with rapid growth through the Navigant acquisition in 2019. The firm has a unique heritage from PwC's public sector business and maintains strong focus on government and regulated industries. Pre-populated CSV data covered all required LinkedIn/BYU fields. Compensation data is less transparent than MBB firms but consistent across multiple sources. The firm appears to have moderate BYU alumni presence (16 current) but no evidence of targeted campus recruiting at BYU."
