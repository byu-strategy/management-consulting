  "notes": "Pre-populated CSV data provided LinkedIn/BYU metrics (all zeros for BYU). Management Consulted profile was comprehensive and recently updated (March 3, 2025). Firm focuses heavily on cultural fit and has no up-or-out model. Primary recruiting from 5 target schools (Emory, Georgia Tech, Howard, Indiana, Michigan) - none of which are BYU. Email format confirmed via LeadIQ. Website was Wix-based and difficult to scrape directly."
