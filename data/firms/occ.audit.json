  "notes": "OC&C Strategy Consultants is a boutique strategy firm with strong consumer/retail DNA, founded in 1987 by former Booz Allen Hamilton consultants. Pre-populated CSV data covered all LinkedIn and BYU fields successfully. The firm has very limited BYU presence (only 1 current alum), suggesting students would need to hustle to break in. Firm became B Corp certified in 2023, which is distinctive. US compensation data from Glassdoor is less robust than for larger firms, but provides reasonable estimates. Notable that firm emphasizes less travel than typical consulting, which could be attractive to students."
