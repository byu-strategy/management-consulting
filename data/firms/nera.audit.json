  "notes": "NERA Economic Consulting is a specialized economic consulting firm (not a traditional strategy firm) that was founded in 1961 and acquired by Marsh McLennan in 1983. The firm has zero BYU/Marriott alumni presence, making it a 'hustle' pipeline for BYU students. CSV data covered all LinkedIn and BYU metrics. NERA's website provided headquarters, founding year, offices, and practice areas. Compensation data came from Indeed (analyst base at $98k) and Glassdoor (average bonus $13-14k). Interview process details from Management Consulted and case interview prep sites. MBA compensation data was not available from public sources. Work-life balance appears demanding but varies significantly by team per Glassdoor reviews (3.2/5 rating)."
