  "notes": "EY-Parthenon was founded in 1991 as Parthenon Group by former Bain consultants and joined Ernst & Young in 2014. The firm is part of the Big 4 but maintains its boutique strategy culture. Used Management Consulted for comprehensive firm data including compensation and offices. Browser extension disconnected during research, preventing LinkedIn alumni count verification. Career path varies by practice area (Strategy vs TSE vs TRS). Email format uses ey.com domain, not parthenon.ey.com."
