  "notes": "Clarkston Consulting is a boutique firm with strong industry focus on life sciences, consumer products, and retail. Founded in 1991 with headquarters in Durham, NC. The firm has zero BYU presence (no current or past alumni), making it a 'hustle' pipeline requiring cold networking. Management Consulted profile exists but has bot protection preventing direct access. Glassdoor provided most compensation and culture insights. The firm uses unique terminology calling employees 'stewards' and has strong wellness programs. Travel is high (Mon-Thu) but culture reviews are generally positive despite demanding hours."
