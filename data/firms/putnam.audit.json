The firm maintains strong life sciences specialization and differentiates with low travel requirements. Zero BYU alumni presence suggests no recruiting relationship. CSV data confirmed all LinkedIn and BYU metrics. Compensation data from Glassdoor reflects averages but MBA-level data was not available."
