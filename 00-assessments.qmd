[Make a copy of the Goals Worksheet](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zq1ih9ZAdjf4K1pisiM6y0NJBAJnn_LezIN6xrWDiIs/copy) to create your own version. Complete it before your Week 2 chat with your TA.
:::

2. **TA Mentoring Sessions (3x)**: Meet with your TA three times for combined practice interviews (behavioral + case) that track your growth:
   - **Session 1 (Weeks 4-5)**: Baseline assessment, identify focus areas

### Practice Interview Log {#practice-interview-log}

**Points**: 100 (20% of grade)

**Overview**

Interview mastery requires deliberate practice of both behavioral and case components. This log documents your practice interview journey throughout the semester. Each practice interview mirrors the actual MBB interview format: a behavioral question followed by a case.

**Practice Interview Format**

Each practice interview includes:

| Component | Time |
|-----------|------|
| Behavioral (1-2 questions) | 15-20 min |
| Case | 30-35 min |
| Feedback | 5-10 min |
| **Total** | **~60 min** |

**Requirements**

Complete a minimum of **8 practice interviews** as the interviewee:

| Source | Sessions | Notes |
|--------|----------|-------|
| Pod peers | 5 | Practice with each pod member once |
| TA | 3 | TA Mentoring Sessions (Weeks 4-5, 9-10, 14) |
| **Total** | **8** | |

When practicing with peers, take turns—you'll also serve as interviewer 5 times.

**Feedback Collection**

::: {.callout-tip}
## Set Up Your Feedback Form

Each student creates their own copy of the feedback form. This ensures your interview feedback remains private. Only you, your pod leader, and Professor Murff can see your scores and comments.

**Setup (do this before your first practice interview):**

1. [Make a copy of the Practice Interview Feedback Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1d8jCv8lEOubJTvoePnVGUxgrjUA2RiHDB7joYFmfqPU/copy)
2. Open the linked response spreadsheet (Responses tab > click the spreadsheet icon)
3. Share the spreadsheet with your pod leader and Professor Murff (View access)
4. Share your form link with your interviewers—they'll submit feedback after each practice interview
:::

After each practice interview, the interviewer completes a feedback form evaluating:

**Behavioral Dimensions:**

- **Impact & Ownership**: Leadership shown, personal actions ("I" not "we"), quantified results
- **Teamwork & Collaboration**: Working with others, influence, navigating conflict
- **Presence & Fit**: Concise (~2 min), confident, authentic, likable

**Case Dimensions:**

- **Structure & Approach**: MECE framework, tailored to problem, prioritized
- **Analytical Rigor**: Math setup, accuracy, "so what" interpretation
- **Hypothesis-Driven Recommendation**: Clear POV, insight-led synthesis, practical and actionable

Each dimension is rated on a 4-point scale:

| Score | Label | Meaning |
|-------|-------|---------|
| 1 | Not Yet | Significant gaps; needs foundational work |
| 2 | Developing | Shows potential but inconsistent |
| 3 | Solid | Meets expectations; ready for most interviews |
| 4 | Strong | Exceeds expectations; would stand out |

**Grading Rubric**

| Component | Points |
|-----------|--------|
| 8 practice interviews completed as interviewee | 50 |
| Google Form feedback submitted for 5 peer interviews (as interviewer) | 20 |
| Thoughtful reflection on improvement over time | 20 |
| Evidence of growth across behavioral AND case dimensions | 10 |
| **Total** | **100** |

### Behavioral Stories: PARADE Framework {#behavioral-stories}

**Overview**

Behavioral interviews are a critical component of consulting recruiting. The PARADE framework helps you structure compelling stories that demonstrate leadership, impact, and fit. You'll practice delivering these stories live during your 8 practice interviews.

**PARADE Framework**

| Element | Question to Answer | What "Good" Looks Like |
|---------|-------------------|------------------------|
| **P**roblem | What was the situation or challenge? | Specific context, stakes are clear, sets up tension |
| **A**ction | What did YOU specifically do? | "I" not "we," concrete actions, shows initiative |
| **R**esult | What was the outcome? | Quantified impact, clear resolution, meaningful scale |
| **A**pplication | How does this relate to consulting? | Connects to skills firms value (leadership, problem-solving, collaboration) |
| **D**ifferentiation | What made your approach unique? | Shows judgment, creativity, or values—not generic |
| **E**vidence | What proves this is true? | Specific details, numbers, names that make it memorable |

**Story Bank: 5 Competencies**

Build stories covering these competencies—firms test for all of them:

| Competency | What Firms Are Testing |
|------------|----------------------|
| **Leadership/Initiative** | Can you take charge and drive outcomes? |
| **Problem-Solving** | Can you navigate ambiguity and find solutions? |
| **Teamwork/Collaboration** | Can you work effectively with others? |
| **Overcoming Challenges** | Can you handle adversity and learn from failure? |
| **Impact/Achievement** | What's your most impressive accomplishment? |

**Quality Checklist**

Before using a story in a practice interview, ask yourself:

- [ ] Can I tell it in under 2 minutes?
- [ ] Do I have at least one quantified result?
- [ ] Is my personal contribution crystal clear?
- [ ] Would I be proud to tell this story to a senior partner?
- [ ] Does it show a trait consulting firms value?

**How This Is Assessed**

Behavioral stories are practiced live during your 8 practice interviews (see [Practice Interview Log](#practice-interview-log)). Each practice interview includes a behavioral component evaluated on:

- **Impact & Ownership**: Clear results, personal actions
- **Teamwork & Collaboration**: Working with others
- **Presence & Fit**: Concise, confident, authentic delivery

Your feedback data across 8 interviews shows your growth in behavioral interviewing over the semester.
