    "text": "Classroom Culture\n\nMission and Aims\nThe mission of Brigham Young University — founded, supported, and guided by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints — is to assist individuals in their quest for perfection and eternal life. That assistance should provide a period of intensive learning in a stimulating setting where a commitment to excellence is expected and the full realization of human potential is pursued.\nBYU seeks to develop students of faith, intellect, and character who have the skills and the desire to continue learning and to serve others throughout their lives.\nA BYU education should be (1) spiritually strengthening, (2) intellectually enlarging, and (3) character building, leading to (4) lifelong learning and service.\nBuilding on the foundational Mission and Aims, the Marriott School of Business aspires to transform the world through Christlike leadership by developing leaders of faith, intellect, and character guided by the following 4 values:\n\nFaith in Christ - We value deep and abiding faith in Jesus Christ. Our faith gives us the capacity to envision a better future, the confidence to make that future happen, and the courage to act in the face of challenges.\nIntegrity in Action - We value integrity and hold ourselves to the highest moral and ethical standards. Acting with integrity builds trust, strengthens character, and focuses our ambitions on things of eternal consequence.\nRespect for All - We value respect for all individuals as children of God and recognize the inherent worth, divine potential, and agency of each person. A climate of respect and belonging enhances our learning, facilitates collaboration, and encourages personal growth.\nExcellence - We value excellence in learning, teaching, research, management, and leadership. An expectation of excellence magnifies our influence and motivates us to continually improve.\n\nWe evaluate our decisions and actions by the impact they will have on the academic experience, professional preparation, character development, emotional well-being, and spiritual growth of our students.\n\nPrayer in class\nWe will begin each class with prayer. Each class member is invited to be voice for the prayer at least once throughout the semester. The TAs will reach out prior to class to invite you to pray on a particular day. If you’d rather not be voice for a prayer please let me know on the first day of class so I can instruct the TAs accordingly.\n\n\nLaptop Policy\nYou may use laptops in class for note taking or other class related purposes. Laptops should not be used for activities that would be a distraction to nearby students when your screen is in their line of sight (e.g. sports, instagram, etc.)\n\n\nCold Calling\nI teach in a fairly conversational style, which includes cold calling students to ask for your input or to pose questions. If you’d rather I not cold call on you please let me know on the first day of class so that I can avoid doing so. I have deep respect for individual learning styles and will make accommodations when needed.",

Little (founded 1886): Initially a chemical consulting firm, it became one of the first to advise on broader business strategy and innovation.\n\n\n\nInstitutionalization (1920s–1950s): The Rise of General Consulting Firms\n\nBooz Allen Hamilton (founded 1914): One of the first firms to offer consulting on organization and strategy.\nMcKinsey & Company (founded 1926): James O. McKinsey introduced accounting-based management principles and later, under Marvin Bower’s leadership, pioneered the professional ethos and structured problem-solving approach still used today.\n\nFocus during this period was on organizational structure, cost control, and formal management systems.\n\n\nPost-War Expansion (1950s–1970s): Strategy Takes Center Stage\n\nThe post-WWII boom led to globalization and complex operations, creating demand for external strategic advice.\nBoston Consulting Group (BCG) was founded in 1963 by Bruce Henderson and introduced landmark strategic tools like the Experience Curve and BCG Matrix.\nStrategic consulting emerged as a distinct domain, emphasizing market positioning, competitive advantage, and long-term planning.\n\n\n\nProfessionalization and Globalization (1980s–1990s):\n\nBain & Company (founded 1973) differentiated itself by focusing on long-term client relationships and measurable impact.\nFirms expanded internationally, serving Fortune 500 clients across industries.\nConsultants became influential in mergers & acquisitions, privatization, and operational restructuring.\nThe 1990s saw the rise of IT consulting (e.g., Accenture, IBM Consulting) alongside traditional strategy firms.\n\n\n\n21st Century: Diversification, Digital, and Disruption (2000–present)\n\nThe Big Three (McKinsey, BCG, Bain) have continued to dominate high-end strategy work.\nConsulting has expanded into:\n\nDigital transformation (e.g., McKinsey Digital, BCG X)\nData analytics & AI\nSustainability and ESG\n\nBoutique firms and freelance platforms (e.g., Toptal, Catalant) challenge traditional models.\nThere is growing scrutiny around ethics, diversity, and impact (e.g., McKinsey’s work with governments and controversial clients).\n\n\n\nKey Contributions to Business Thinking\nFrameworks like Porter’s Five Forces, the GE-McKinsey matrix, value chain analysis, and zero-based budgeting were either developed or popularized by consulting firms. Management consulting has significantly influenced MBA education, corporate strategy, and even public policy.",

    "text": "MECE thinking, issue trees, hypothesis-driven problem solving\nMECE stands for Mutually Exclusive, Collectively Exhaustive. It’s a principle used in structured problem-solving—especially in consulting (e.g., McKinsey)—to break down complex problems into categories or sub-problems that are:\nMutually Exclusive: No overlap—each element in a breakdown fits in only one category. Collectively Exhaustive: No gaps—the categories together cover all possible options or components. Example: If you’re segmenting customers, a MECE breakdown might look like:\nBy age: 18–25, 26–35, 36–45, 46+ These are mutually exclusive (no person falls in two buckets) And collectively exhaustive (every customer falls in one bucket) Why it matters: It helps avoid double-counting or missing key elements. It supports clear communication and logical analysis. It forms the basis of tools like issue trees and hypothesis trees. Consultants often use MECE to structure analyses, recommendations, and slide decks.\n\nThe Pyramid Principle",
