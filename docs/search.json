    "text": "1.6 Classroom Culture\n\n1.6.1 Mission and Aims\nThe mission of Brigham Young University — founded, supported, and guided by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints — is to assist individuals in their quest for perfection and eternal life. That assistance should provide a period of intensive learning in a stimulating setting where a commitment to excellence is expected and the full realization of human potential is pursued.\nBYU seeks to develop students of faith, intellect, and character who have the skills and the desire to continue learning and to serve others throughout their lives.\nA BYU education should be (1) spiritually strengthening, (2) intellectually enlarging, and (3) character building, leading to (4) lifelong learning and service.\nBuilding on the foundational Mission and Aims, the Marriott School of Business aspires to transform the world through Christlike leadership by developing leaders of faith, intellect, and character guided by the following 4 values:\n\nFaith in Christ - We value deep and abiding faith in Jesus Christ. Our faith gives us the capacity to envision a better future, the confidence to make that future happen, and the courage to act in the face of challenges.\nIntegrity in Action - We value integrity and hold ourselves to the highest moral and ethical standards. Acting with integrity builds trust, strengthens character, and focuses our ambitions on things of eternal consequence.\nRespect for All - We value respect for all individuals as children of God and recognize the inherent worth, divine potential, and agency of each person. A climate of respect and belonging enhances our learning, facilitates collaboration, and encourages personal growth.\nExcellence - We value excellence in learning, teaching, research, management, and leadership. An expectation of excellence magnifies our influence and motivates us to continually improve.\n\nWe evaluate our decisions and actions by the impact they will have on the academic experience, professional preparation, character development, emotional well-being, and spiritual growth of our students.\n\n1.6.1.1 Prayer in class\nWe will begin each class with prayer. Each class member is invited to be voice for the prayer at least once throughout the semester. The TAs will reach out prior to class to invite you to pray on a particular day. If you’d rather not be voice for a prayer please let me know on the first day of class so I can instruct the TAs accordingly.\n\n\n1.6.1.2 Laptop Policy\nYou may use laptops in class for note taking or other class related purposes. Laptops should not be used for activities that would be a distraction to nearby students when your screen is in their line of sight (e.g. sports, instagram, etc.)\n\n\n1.6.1.3 Cold Calling\nI teach in a fairly conversational style, which includes cold calling students to ask for your input or to pose questions. If you’d rather I not cold call on you please let me know on the first day of class so that I can avoid doing so. I have deep respect for individual learning styles and will make accommodations when needed.",

    "section": "3.3 Disaggregate",
    "text": "3.3 Disaggregate\n\n3.3.1 MECE\nOnce the problem is clearly defined, the next step is to break it into smaller parts that can be tackled systematically. This is where the MECE principle comes in which stands for Mutually Exclusive, Collectively Exhaustive, a cornerstone of structured problem solving used extensively in management consulting and corporate strategy.\nMECE ensures that:\n\nEach subcomponent is distinct (no overlap), and\n\nTogether they cover the whole space (no gaps).\n\nA well-disaggregated problem makes your analysis cleaner, your thinking sharper, and your recommendations easier to defend. Whether you’re building an issue tree, framing hypotheses, or designing slides, applying MECE sets the foundation for everything that follows.\n\n\n3.3.2 When MECE Is Easy\nSuppose you’re segmenting adult customers by age. A MECE-compliant breakdown might look like:\n\n18–24\n\n25–34\n\n35–44\n\n45+\n\nThese categories are:\n\nMutually Exclusive – No overlap (e.g., a 25-year-old doesn’t appear in two groups).\nCollectively Exhaustive – Every customer belongs to one and only one group.\n\nThis kind of clean segmentation supports accurate analysis, avoids double-counting, and ensures no one is missed.\nNow compare that to this alternative breakdown:\n\nUnder 25\n\n25–35\n\n35–50\n\nThis version has two key issues:\n\nNot Mutually Exclusive – A 25- or 35-year-old could fall into two groups.\nNot Collectively Exhaustive – Customers over 50 aren’t accounted for.\n\nFlawed segmentation like this can lead to analytical errors, communication confusion, and poor decisions.\n\n\n3.3.3 When MECE Is Hard\nNow consider a messier problem: analyzing why employees leave a company. Reasons for leaving are often overlapping, subjective, and hard to categorize cleanly.\nYou might start with a messy list like this:\n\nLow pay\n\nPoor management\n\nLack of career growth\n\nBurnout\n\nWork-life imbalance\n\nCulture misfit\n\nRelocation\n\nHealth issues\n\nRetirement\n\nLack of challenge\n\nBenefits dissatisfaction\n\nFamily obligations\n\nThis list suffers from two major issues:\n\nOverlap – (e.g., burnout might be caused by both poor management and work-life imbalance).\n\nNo structure – There’s no grouping or logical hierarchy to guide analysis.\n\nNow let’s apply MECE as a guiding principle to impose more structure:\n\nCompensation-related:\n\nLow pay\n\nBenefits dissatisfaction\n\nWork environment:\n\nPoor management\n\nCulture misfit\n\nWork-life imbalance\n\nBurnout\n\nCareer factors:\n\nLack of career growth\n\nLack of challenge\n\nPersonal/life factors:\n\nRelocation\n\nHealth issues\n\nFamily obligations\n\nRetirement\n\n\nThis version isn’t perfect, but it’s:\n\nMore mutually exclusive – Each reason fits into a single logical category.\n\nCloser to collectively exhaustive – Fewer gaps and better coverage.\n\nEasier to use – For analysis, discussion, and recommendations.\n\n\nIn practice, it’s rare to achieve a perfectly MECE breakdown. Real-world problems are messy and ambiguous. But MECE remains a powerful thinking tool. Striving for it helps you uncover overlaps, spot gaps, and structure your work with clarity. Even when perfection isn’t possible, the act of trying often leads to better insights and more rigorous analysis.\n\n\n\n3.3.4 Why Being MECE Is Useful\n\nHelps avoid double-counting or missing key elements\n\nSupports clear communication and logical analysis\n\nForms the basis of tools like issue trees and hypothesis trees\n\nStrengthens the rigor of your thinking and storytelling\n\n\n\n3.3.5 Issue Trees\nAn issue tree, sometimes called a logic tree, is a visual tool that helps you disaggregate a complex problem into its component parts. It takes the abstract and makes it concrete by showing how the high-level problem breaks down into smaller, analyzable questions or drivers.\nAt its core, an issue tree is simply a structured hierarchy of “sub-questions” or “drivers” that, together, answer the original problem. To be effective, each level of the tree should strive to be MECE.\nSuppose a company is experiencing declining profits. An issue tree might break the problem down like this:\n\n\n\n\n\ngraph TD\n    A[Why are profits declining?] --&gt; B[Revenue declining?]\n    A --&gt; C[Costs increasing?]\n    B --&gt; D[Price decreasing?]\n    B --&gt; E[Volume decreasing?]\n    C --&gt; F[Fixed costs increasing?]\n    C --&gt; G[Variable costs increasing?]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis tree:\nBreaks the top-level problem into two distinct branches: revenue and costs.\nThen further disaggregates those branches into logical, MECE subcomponents.\nThis structure gives you a clear starting point for analysis, hypothesis generation, and workstream planning.",
