### How to Give a Practice Interview

This guide is for both students (giving cases to pod members) and TAs (running mentoring sessions). A well-run practice interview helps the candidate improve; a poorly-run one wastes everyone's time.

#### Session Format

Each practice interview follows the MBB format:

| Component | Time |
|-----------|------|
| Behavioral (1-2 questions) | 15-20 min |
| Case | 30-35 min |
| Feedback | 5-10 min |
| **Total** | **~60 min** |

See the [Practice Interview Log](00-assessments.qmd#practice-interview-log) for the feedback form and rubric.

#### Before the Session

1. **Select a case** from the [Case Library](#case-library) below
2. **Work through the case yourself** – know the answer before you give it
3. **Prepare 1-2 behavioral questions** (e.g., "Tell me about a time you led a team through a challenge")
4. **Have the feedback form ready** – you'll rate 6 dimensions

#### Running the Behavioral Portion

Ask open-ended questions and listen for what you'll rate:

| Dimension | What to Listen For |
|-----------|-------------------|
| **Impact & Ownership** | Are they saying "I" not "we"? Do they quantify results? |
| **Teamwork & Collaboration** | How did they work with others? Navigate conflict? |
| **Presence & Fit** | Is the answer concise (~2 min)? Confident and authentic? |

Take notes as they speak – don't try to remember everything for feedback later. If answers are vague, push for specifics: "What did YOU specifically do?"

#### Running the Case

Read the prompt clearly and pause for clarifying questions. Then let the candidate drive.

**Listen for what you'll rate:**

| Dimension | What to Listen For |
|-----------|-------------------|
| **Structure & Approach** | Is the framework MECE? Tailored to this specific problem? |
| **Analytical Rigor** | Do they set up math correctly? Interpret the "so what"? |
| **Hypothesis-Driven Recommendation** | Do they synthesize to a clear point of view? |

**Key behaviors:**

- Resist the urge to help too early – let them struggle productively
- Provide data/exhibits when asked appropriately
- Don't give away the answer
- Track time; give a 5-minute warning
- Always ask for a final recommendation at the end

#### Giving Effective Feedback

Good feedback is specific and actionable.

1. **Start with 1-2 specific strengths** – "Your structure was MECE and you prioritized the right branch first"
2. **Identify 1-2 areas for improvement** – "You didn't interpret your math; you said '15%' but didn't explain what that means for the decision"
3. **Reference the 4-point scale** – help them understand where they are relative to the bar
4. **Compare to MBB expectations** – what would "strong" look like?

Avoid vague feedback like "that was good" or "nice job." Be specific.

#### Common Interviewer Mistakes

| Mistake | Why It Hurts |
|---------|-------------|
| Giving hints too early | Candidate doesn't learn to work through ambiguity |
| Interrupting structure presentation | Breaks candidate's flow and confidence |
| Not tracking time | Case runs too long or gets rushed |
| Generic feedback | Candidate doesn't know what to improve |
| Making it too easy or too hard | Doesn't reflect real interview conditions |
