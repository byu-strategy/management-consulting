title: "Leveraging AI"
---

AI is not a standalone topic in this course. It is the way you will apply nearly every part of *The Consultant's OS* more effectively.

Starting in Week 2, you'll learn how to use AI tools to accelerate your research, sharpen your analysis, and improve how you are able to communicate. The OS remains the foundation; AI simply increases your leverage.

## Getting Leverage with AI

Think of AI as an amplifier for *The Consultant's OS*:

| OS Capability | Without AI | With AI |
|:--------------|:-----------|:--------|
| **Research** | Hours of manual searching | Rapid synthesis across sources |
| **Analysis** | Slow iteration on models | Fast hypothesis testing |
| **Communication** | Multiple draft cycles | Accelerated refinement |
| **Learning** | Delayed feedback | Instant practice partner |

AI doesn't replace judgment, structure, or rigor. It makes each of them faster, cheaper, and more scalable.

You'll use two broad categories of AI tools in this course. Both rely on the same underlying language models. In principle, either could answer the same question.

The difference isn't the underlying model but the tools wrapped around it. Web chatbots operate through a browser interface with limited, manual file uploads and limited agentic behavior. AI agents operate through you a code editor and terminal (CLI), with direct access to your file system, the ability to execute code, and the capacity to chain actions together. Same model but different capabilities.

This leads to an emerging discipline you'll practice throughout the course: **context engineering**, which is deciding what information an AI system has access to when it responds.

- **Prompt engineering** focuses on *how you ask*: wording, structure, and tactics for framing a request.
- **Context engineering** focuses on *what the AI knows*: your files, your data, your project, and your constraints.

You can write a great prompt, but if the AI doesn't have access to your data, your documents, or know about your project, it can only be so helpful. Context engineering is about optimizing what information and tools the AI model has access to in order to push it's abilities far beyond what's possible from a prompt in a web based chatbot. 

### Web Chatbots

**Tools:** [Claude](https://claude.ai), [ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com), [Gemini](https://gemini.google.com)

Web-based chatbots are amazing, almost magical conversational interfaces. You type; the AI responds; you refine. They live in your browser and require no setup.

You can upload files to chatbots, but that context is manual and fragile. You decide what to upload, conversation by conversation. The AI sees only what you explicitly provide, cannot infer relationships across files, and forgets everything once the conversation ends.

Chatbots are ideal when the AI doesn't need deep knowledge of your specific project. They shine in situations like:

- **Research and synthesis** — Understanding industries, companies, or unfamiliar concepts
- **Structuring thinking** — Building MECE frameworks, testing hypotheses, developing storylines
- **Writing and editing** — Drafting emails, refining prose, sharpening arguments
- **Practice and preparation** — Case interview drills, networking conversation prep

When you just need to think, explore, or communicate, chatbots are often the fastest option.

### AI Agents:

**Tools:** Claude Code, Gemini CLI, GitHub Copilot, OpenAI Codex, Cursor

AI agents use the same underlying models as web chatbots but they are accessed and operate primarily through a locally installed terminal or code editor such as VS Code, Antigravity, or Cursor. 

That is, AI agents are accessed via tools that historically have been the domain of software developers and data scientists, in places where few consultants dared enter.

For most of computing history, these tools required specialized knowledge that tools years to develop. You had to understand syntax, commands, file systems, and obscure error messages. Those knowledge barriers kept them largely confined to developers.

**That barrier is now gone.**

Large language models are fundamentally **text-in, text-out** systems. They excel at reading text, generating text, and reasoning over text.

VS Code and the command line (terminal) are also fundamentally text-based:

- Source files are text
- Data files are often text
- Logs and errors are text
- Commands are text

This makes them the **native habitat of LLMs**.

Graphical user interfaces (GUIs) were designed for humans. Because we are vision-dominant, windows, icons, and buttons made computers easier to use. Even the name *Windows* is a self-reference to this design choice.
But what is intuitive for humans is often unnecessary for AI agents, which operate natively in text.

This has led to a "CLI renissance" where the command line is very much back in style and more powerful than ever before. 

With AI agents assisting you, tools that once required years of training now allow you to describe what you want in plain English while the AI translates that intent into concrete actions.

This is the quiet revolution that so far few people have put words to or are fully appreciating: **developer tools have become general-purpose thinking and execution tools for all knowledge workers.**

Because agents operate inside your editor and terminal, they gain something chatbots cannot: **full context**.

They can:

- Read your project files
- Understand how documents and data relate
- Write new files and modify existing ones
- Run code, see errors, and fix them
- Chain multi-step workflows end to end

A useful mental model:

> A web chatbot knows everything about the world but nothing about your project.
>
> An AI agent knows everything about the world *and* can see exactly what you're working on.

That difference matters enormously when you want to get the most out of AI models. 

### Chatbots vs AI Agents

| Criteria | Web Chatbot | AI Agent |
|:---------|:------------|:---------|
| **Response speed** | Faster | Slightly slower (reads files first) |
| **Setup required** | None (just a browser) | Installation required |
| **File context** | Manual upload, limited | Automatic, full project access |
| **Code execution** | Limited (sandboxed Python) | Full (any language, your machine) |
| **Output persists** | No (copy-paste) | Yes (writes to files) |
| **Best for** | Thinking and drafting | Building and executing |

### When to Use Each

| If you need to... | Web Chatbot | AI Agent |
|:------------------|:-----------:|:--------:|
| Brainstorm ideas | ✓ | ✓ |
| Research a company | ✓ | ✓ |
| Structure an argument | ✓ | ✓ |
| Practice a case interview | ✓ | |
| Analyze *your* dataset | | ✓ |
| Build a model from *your* data | | ✓ |
| Create files or deliverables | | ✓ |
| Automate a repetitive task | | ✓ |

**Rule of thumb: if the AI needs to take action, use an agent. Otherwise, use whatever is fastest.**

What counts as "action"? Anything beyond generating text:

- **Reading your files** — analyzing datasets, reviewing documents, understanding your project
- **Writing files** — creating deliverables, saving outputs, building persistent artifacts
- **Running code** — executing scripts, testing solutions, iterating on errors
- **Searching your system** — finding files, grepping through codebases, locating specific content
- **Executing commands** — installing packages, running builds, interacting with APIs
- **Chaining operations** — multi-step workflows where each step depends on the last

If your task involves any of these, reach for an agent. If you just need to think through a problem or get information, a chatbot in your browser is faster and simpler.

## Setting Up Your AI Workflow

### The Tools

**VS Code** is the open-source code editor (often called an IDE for Integrated Development Environment) that serves as the foundation for many AI coding tools. Both **Cursor** and **Antigravity** are built on top of VS Code, adding AI capabilities while preserving the familiar interface. If you learn one, you can use the others.

**Recommended setup for this course:**

- **Antigravity** (Google) — Our primary tool due to its generous free tier
- **Claude Code** — Recommended for students who want the most capable agentic coding experience ($20/mo). You can access Claude Code from any of VS Code, Antigravity, or Cursor, all of which have a very simliar look and feel. If you know one, you know them all.

## AI Ethics and Professional Standards

### What's Acceptable

- Using AI to accelerate research you would do anyway
- Getting feedback on your writing and logic
- Practicing cases with AI as a partner
- Generating first drafts that you then refine

### What's Not Acceptable

- Submitting AI-generated work as entirely your own without disclosure
- Using AI during actual interviews (unless explicitly permitted)
- Relying on AI without developing your own judgment

### The 80/20 Rule

AI can get you 80% of the way quickly. The last 20%, including judgment, nuance, and client context, is where you add value. Never outsource your thinking entirely.

## Getting Started This Week
