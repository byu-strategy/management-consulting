title: "Leveraging AI"
---

AI is not a separate topic in this course, rather it's how you'll apply nearly every part of *The Consultant's OS* more effectively. From Week 2 onward, you'll learn to use AI tools to accelerate your research, analysis, and communication.

## AI as Your Operating Amplifier

Think of AI as an amplifier for *The Consultant's OS*:

| OS Capability | Without AI | With AI |
|:--------------|:-----------|:--------|
| **Research** | Hours of manual searching | Rapid synthesis of sources |
| **Analysis** | Slow iteration on models | Fast hypothesis testing |
| **Communication** | Multiple draft cycles | Accelerated refinement |
| **Learning** | Wait for feedback | Instant practice partner |

AI doesn't replace the OS but makes each action faster and more powerful.

## Tools You'll Use

### Claude (Anthropic)

Your primary AI assistant for:

- Research synthesis and fact-finding
- Structuring arguments and storylines
- Case interview practice
- Writing and editing

### Claude Code / Cursor

AI-assisted coding environment for:

- Data analysis and visualization
- Model building
- Automating repetitive tasks
- Working with large datasets

## Setting Up Your AI Workflow

### Step 1: Create Your Accounts

1. **Claude**: Sign up at [claude.ai](https://claude.ai) (free tier is sufficient)
2. **VS Code or Cursor**: Download and install on your laptop

### Step 2: Configure Your Environment

[Detailed setup instructions TBD]

### Step 3: Practice the Basics

Try these starter exercises:

1. **Research synthesis**: "What are the key trends affecting [your target company's] industry?"
2. **Structure building**: "Help me create a MECE issue tree for [problem]"
3. **Case practice**: "Give me a market sizing question and walk through it with me"

## AI-Assisted Consulting Actions

### Think Clearly with AI

| Core Action | How AI Helps |
|:------------|:-------------|
| Diagnose current state | Synthesize news, filings, analyst reports quickly |
| Define the problem | Pressure-test your problem statement for clarity |
| Build MECE structures | Generate and critique issue trees |

### Get to the Right Answer with AI

| Core Action | How AI Helps |
|:------------|:-------------|
| Build fact base | Research companies, industries, competitors rapidly |
| Estimate and bound | Sanity-check assumptions, find benchmarks |
| Synthesize | Draft "so what" statements, identify patterns |

### Move Work Forward with AI

| Core Action | How AI Helps |
|:------------|:-------------|
| Workplanning | Draft project plans, identify dependencies |
| Progress without certainty | Explore multiple scenarios quickly |

### Create Impact with AI

| Core Action | How AI Helps |
|:------------|:-------------|
| Craft storylines | Structure Pyramid Principle arguments |
| Communicate with brevity | Edit for conciseness, strengthen logic |
| Prepare for stakeholders | Anticipate questions, practice responses |

## AI Ethics and Professional Standards

### What's Acceptable

- Using AI to accelerate research you would do anyway
- Getting feedback on your writing and logic
- Practicing cases with AI as a partner
- Generating first drafts that you then refine

### What's Not Acceptable

- Submitting AI-generated work as entirely your own without disclosure
- Using AI during actual interviews (unless explicitly permitted)
- Relying on AI without developing your own judgment

### The 80/20 Rule

AI can get you 80% of the way quickly. The last 20%, including judgment, nuance, and client context, is where you add value. Never outsource your thinking entirely.

## Weekly AI Integration

Throughout this course, AI is woven into every assignment:

| Week | AI Application |
|:-----|:---------------|
| 2 | Setup and basic research |
| 3-5 | Problem structuring and hypothesis testing |
| 6-8 | Research synthesis and analysis |
| 9-10 | Workplanning and iteration |
| 11-14 | Communication refinement and practice |
| 15 | Capstone polish |

## Getting Started This Week

By the end of Week 2, you should be able to:

1. ✅ Access Claude and have a basic conversation
2. ✅ Use Claude to research a company
3. ✅ Set up VS Code or Cursor on your laptop
4. ✅ Run a basic analysis with AI assistance

Come to class ready to demonstrate your setup.
