title: "Leveraging AI"
---

AI is not a separate topic in this course, rather it's how you'll apply nearly every part of *The Consultant's OS* more effectively. From Week 2 onward, you'll learn to use AI tools to accelerate your research, analysis, and communication.

## AI as Your Amplifier

Think of AI as an amplifier for *The Consultant's OS*:

| OS Capability | Without AI | With AI |
|:--------------|:-----------|:--------|
| **Research** | Hours of manual searching | Rapid synthesis of sources |
| **Analysis** | Slow iteration on models | Fast hypothesis testing |
| **Communication** | Multiple draft cycles | Accelerated refinement |
| **Learning** | Wait for feedback | Instant practice partner |

AI doesn't replace the OS but makes each action faster and more powerful.

## Tools You'll Use

### Claude, ChatGPT, Gemini

Your primary AI assistant for:

- Research synthesis and fact-finding
- Structuring arguments and storylines
- Case interview practice
- Writing and editing

### Claude Code / Cursor

AI-assisted coding environment for:

- Data analysis and visualization
- Model building
- Automating repetitive tasks
- Working with large datasets

## Setting Up Your AI Workflow

### Step 1: Install Software

1. **VS Code Cursor**: Download and install on your laptop

### Step 2: Configure Your Environment

Demoed in Class

### Step 3: Practice the Basics

## Session 2 Activity: AI as Your Operating Amplifier

### Recruiting: AI-powered networking prep

Use AI to prepare for networking conversations by researching the person and firm before you reach out.

**Conversation Goals**
Help me identify:
- 1-2 specific things I want to learn from this conversation
- How I can be helpful or interesting to them (not just ask for things)
- A natural way to follow up after the conversation
```

## AI Ethics and Professional Standards

### What's Acceptable

- Using AI to accelerate research you would do anyway
- Getting feedback on your writing and logic
- Practicing cases with AI as a partner
- Generating first drafts that you then refine

### What's Not Acceptable

- Submitting AI-generated work as entirely your own without disclosure
- Using AI during actual interviews (unless explicitly permitted)
- Relying on AI without developing your own judgment

### The 80/20 Rule

AI can get you 80% of the way quickly. The last 20%, including judgment, nuance, and client context, is where you add value. Never outsource your thinking entirely.
