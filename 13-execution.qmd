# Execution and Workplanning

Consulting is ultimately about execution. This chapter covers how to plan work, manage upward, handle difficult conversations, and leverage AI for maximum productivity—skills that separate good consultants from great ones.

## Workplanning Fundamentals

### What is a Workplan?

A workplan is a structured document that maps out:

- **What** needs to be done (analyses, deliverables)
- **Who** will do it (team assignments)
- **When** it needs to be complete (timeline)
- **How** it connects to the answer (storyboard)

Every consulting engagement starts with a workplan, and the best consultants update it constantly as the work evolves.

### The Workplan Structure

| Element | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| **Key question** | The main problem we're solving |
| **Hypotheses** | Our best guess at the answer |
| **Analyses** | Work required to test hypotheses |
| **Owners** | Who's responsible for each analysis |
| **Timeline** | When each piece is due |
| **Dependencies** | What needs to happen before what |

### Building a Workplan

**Step 1: Start with the end**

What will the final deliverable look like? Work backwards from there.

**Step 2: Break into workstreams**

Divide the work into 3-5 logical chunks. Each workstream should be:

- Relatively independent
- Assignable to a person or sub-team
- Clear in scope and output

**Step 3: Identify key analyses**

For each workstream, list the specific analyses needed:

- Data to gather
- Interviews to conduct
- Models to build
- Benchmarks to compile

**Step 4: Sequence the work**

What must happen first? What can be done in parallel? Map dependencies.

**Step 5: Assign and timeline**

Who owns what? When is each piece due?

### Example Workplan

```
PROJECT: Cost Reduction Diagnostic
TIMELINE: 4 weeks

WORKSTREAM 1: Procurement Analysis (Sarah)
  Week 1: Gather spend data by category
  Week 2: Benchmark against industry standards
  Week 3: Identify top 5 savings opportunities
  Week 4: Quantify and prioritize

WORKSTREAM 2: Operations Efficiency (Mike)
  Week 1: Map current processes
  Week 2: Conduct plant visits and interviews
  Week 3: Identify waste and inefficiency
  Week 4: Develop improvement recommendations

WORKSTREAM 3: Organizational Review (Lisa)
  Week 1: Analyze org structure and spans
  Week 2: Benchmark staffing ratios
  Week 3: Identify optimization opportunities
  Week 4: Model scenarios

INTEGRATION POINTS:
  End of Week 2: Share preliminary findings
  End of Week 3: Align on recommendations
  Week 4: Build integrated final presentation
```

## Managing Upward

As a junior consultant, you'll work for managers, partners, and clients. Managing upward is essential.

### Principles of Managing Up

**1. Make your manager's job easier**

Think about what they need and provide it before being asked:

- Status updates at predictable intervals
- Early flags on problems
- Proposed solutions, not just problems

**2. Communicate proactively**

Don't wait to be asked. Update regularly on:

- What you've completed
- What you're working on
- Where you're blocked
- What you need

**3. Ask for feedback**

Request specific feedback early and often:

> "I'm about to start the analysis. Can you take 5 minutes to review my approach before I dive in?"

**4. Manage expectations**

If a deadline is at risk, flag it immediately—don't surprise anyone.

### The Status Update Template

A good status update is brief and structured:

> **Progress:** Completed X, Y. Currently working on Z.
>
> **Blockers:** Waiting on data from client finance team.
>
> **Help needed:** Can you escalate the data request?
>
> **Next steps:** Will have draft analysis by EOD Thursday.

## Difficult Conversations: The Yes-No-Yes Framework

Consulting requires courage—the ability to deliver hard truths, push back on unreasonable requests, and maintain boundaries. The **Yes-No-Yes framework** helps navigate these moments.

### The Framework

| Step | Purpose | Example |
|------|---------|---------|
| **Yes (1)** | Affirm the relationship or shared goal | "I value our working relationship and want to deliver great work for you." |
| **No** | State your boundary or concern clearly | "However, I'm not able to work through the entire weekend on this timeline." |
| **Yes (2)** | Offer an alternative path forward | "What I can do is prioritize the critical sections and have those ready by Monday." |

### When to Use It

**Unreasonable deadlines:**

> "Yes—I understand how important this client presentation is. No—I can't deliver 50 polished slides by tomorrow morning. Yes—I can get you 20 key slides tonight and finish the rest by noon."

**Scope creep:**

> "Yes—the additional analysis would strengthen the recommendation. No—adding it at this point would delay the final delivery. Yes—we could include it as a follow-on workstream after the initial phase."

**Feedback you disagree with:**

> "Yes—I appreciate the feedback and want to improve. No—I don't think that characterization fully captures the situation. Yes—I'd welcome a conversation to understand your perspective better."

**Personal boundaries:**

> "Yes—I'm committed to this project's success. No—I have a family commitment this Saturday that I can't move. Yes—I'll ensure my work is on track before then and be available Sunday if needed."

### Why It Works

The Yes-No-Yes framework works because it:

1. **Maintains relationships** – The first "yes" affirms connection
2. **Establishes clarity** – The "no" is direct, not passive-aggressive
3. **Preserves momentum** – The second "yes" offers a path forward

Without structure, difficult conversations often become:

- **All yes** – You overcommit and burn out
- **All no** – You seem uncooperative
- **Passive avoidance** – Problems fester

### Practicing Yes-No-Yes

Write out your Yes-No-Yes for common scenarios before you need them:

| Scenario | Your Yes-No-Yes |
|----------|----------------|
| Asked to work every weekend | ? |
| Assigned to a project that's not a fit | ? |
| Manager takes credit for your work | ? |
| Client requests additional scope | ? |

## Advanced AI Workflows

By now, you've been using AI throughout the course. Let's level up your workflows for maximum impact.

### The Power User Approach

**1. Chain prompts for depth**

Don't ask one question—build a conversation:

> **Prompt 1:** "Summarize the key findings from this earnings call."
>
> **Prompt 2:** "Based on those findings, what strategic questions should we investigate?"
>
> **Prompt 3:** "For the top question, outline an analytical approach."
>
> **Prompt 4:** "Draft an executive summary slide with action title."

**2. Use AI to challenge your thinking**

> "Here's my hypothesis: [X]. Play devil's advocate and give me the three strongest counterarguments."

**3. Generate alternatives**

> "I'm thinking of structuring this analysis as [approach]. What are two alternative approaches I should consider?"

**4. Speed up iteration**

> "Here's my draft slide. Improve the action title, simplify the key message, and suggest a better visual format."

### AI for Capstone Execution

| Task | AI Prompt Approach |
|------|-------------------|
| **Company research** | "Based on [company's] 10-K and recent earnings, summarize key strategic challenges with evidence." |
| **Competitive analysis** | "Compare [company] to [competitors] on [metrics]. What are the key insights?" |
| **Hypothesis generation** | "Given these challenges, what are 3 potential value-add opportunities for a consulting engagement?" |
| **Quantification** | "Help me estimate the value of [opportunity] using reasonable assumptions. Show the math." |
| **Slide drafting** | "Draft a slide that communicates [insight]. Use an action title and suggest a visual." |
| **Critique** | "Review this slide for clarity, accuracy, and persuasiveness. What would you change?" |

### Prompt Engineering Principles

**Be specific:**

| Weak | Strong |
|------|--------|
| "Analyze this company" | "Identify the 3 key strategic challenges facing [company] based on their 2024 10-K, with specific evidence for each" |

**Set the context:**

> "You are a management consultant preparing a client presentation. The audience is the CEO and CFO. They have 15 minutes..."

**Request structure:**

> "Format your response as: (1) Key insight, (2) Supporting evidence, (3) Implications, (4) Recommended action"

**Ask for reasoning:**

> "Explain your reasoning for each recommendation."

## Time Management for Consultants

### The 80/20 in Practice

Not all work creates equal value. Identify the 20% of analyses that will drive 80% of the insight.

**Before diving in, ask:**

- What's the most important thing to figure out?
- What would change the recommendation?
- What does the partner/client care most about?

### Managing Energy, Not Just Time

Consulting is demanding. Manage your energy:

| High Energy Time | Use For |
|-----------------|---------|
| Morning peak | Complex analysis, writing |
| Post-lunch dip | Email, admin, routine tasks |
| Afternoon second wind | Meetings, collaboration |
| Evening | Review, plan tomorrow |

### The Sunday Night Reset

Every Sunday, spend 20 minutes:

1. Review the week ahead
2. Identify the 3 most important things
3. Block time for deep work
4. Anticipate challenges

## Practice Exercise

1. **Build a workplan** for your capstone project. Identify workstreams, key analyses, owners, and timeline.

2. **Write your Yes-No-Yes scripts** for three difficult conversations you might face in consulting (or have faced in other contexts).

3. **Chain 5 AI prompts** to go from a broad research question to a draft executive summary slide. Document each prompt and how you iterated.

4. **Time audit** – Track how you spend your time for one day. Where is the 80/20? What could you eliminate or delegate?
