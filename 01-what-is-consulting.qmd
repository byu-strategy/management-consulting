title: "What is Consulting?"
---

Understanding the consulting industry—its history, major players, and what consultants actually do—helps you make informed decisions about where to focus your recruiting efforts and how to position yourself effectively.

## What Consultants Actually Do

At its core, consulting is about helping organizations solve problems they can't solve on their own. This might be because they:

- Lack the expertise (specialized knowledge)
- Lack the capacity (not enough people)
- Lack the objectivity (too close to the problem)
- Need external validation (board/investor credibility)

### The Day-to-Day Reality

A typical week as a junior consultant might include:

- **Monday**: Team kickoff, review workplan, divide analyses
- **Tuesday-Wednesday**: Build models, conduct research, synthesize findings
- **Thursday**: Internal team check-in, refine storyline
- **Friday**: Client working session or steering committee presentation

The work is intellectually demanding, fast-paced, and highly collaborative.

## The History of Management Consulting

### Early Roots (1880s–1920s): Birth of Scientific Management

- **Frederick Winslow Taylor**: Often considered the father of management consulting, Taylor pioneered scientific management or "Taylorism" in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, emphasizing efficiency and productivity through time-and-motion studies.
- **Arthur D. Little (founded 1886)**: Initially a chemical consulting firm, it became one of the first to advise on broader business strategy and innovation.

### Institutionalization (1920s–1950s): The Rise of General Consulting Firms

- **Booz Allen Hamilton (founded 1914)**: One of the first firms to offer consulting on organization and strategy.
- **McKinsey & Company (founded 1926)**: James O. McKinsey introduced accounting-based management principles and later, under Marvin Bower's leadership, pioneered the professional ethos and structured problem-solving approach still used today.

Focus during this period was on organizational structure, cost control, and formal management systems.

### Post-War Expansion (1950s–1970s): Strategy Takes Center Stage

- The post-WWII boom led to globalization and complex operations, creating demand for external strategic advice.
- **Boston Consulting Group (BCG)** was founded in 1963 by Bruce Henderson and introduced landmark strategic tools like the Experience Curve and BCG Matrix.
- Strategic consulting emerged as a distinct domain, emphasizing market positioning, competitive advantage, and long-term planning.

### Professionalization and Globalization (1980s–1990s)

- **Bain & Company (founded 1973)** differentiated itself by focusing on long-term client relationships and measurable impact.
- Firms expanded internationally, serving Fortune 500 clients across industries.
- Consultants became influential in mergers & acquisitions, privatization, and operational restructuring.
- The 1990s saw the rise of IT consulting (e.g., Accenture, IBM Consulting) alongside traditional strategy firms.

### 21st Century: Diversification, Digital, and Disruption (2000–present)

- The Big Three (McKinsey, BCG, Bain) have continued to dominate high-end strategy work.
- Consulting has expanded into:
    - Digital transformation (e.g., McKinsey Digital, BCG X)
    - Data analytics & AI
    - Sustainability and ESG
- Boutique firms and freelance platforms (e.g., Toptal, Catalant) challenge traditional models.
- There is growing scrutiny around ethics, diversity, and impact.

### Key Contributions to Business Thinking

Frameworks like Porter's Five Forces, the GE-McKinsey matrix, value chain analysis, and zero-based budgeting were either developed or popularized by consulting firms. Management consulting has significantly influenced MBA education, corporate strategy, and even public policy.
