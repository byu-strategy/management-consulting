title: "Do Client Work"
---

This chapter brings together everything in the Consultant's OS as it applies to client work. Through your projects this semester, you'll practice being a consultant—not just learning about consulting.

## The Consulting OS in Practice

The course projects simulate real consulting engagements:

| Project | Consulting Parallel | OS Imperatives Used |
|:--------|:-------------------|:--------------------|
| **P1: Company Diagnostic** | Quick outside-in scan | Think Clearly, Get to the Right Answer |
| **P2: Competitive Benchmark** | Competitive analysis | Get to the Right Answer, Create Impact |
| **P3: Value-Add Hypothesis** | Opportunity identification | Think Clearly, Get to the Right Answer |
| **Capstone** | Full strategic proposal | All Four Imperatives |

## What Consultants Actually Deliver

### Common Deliverables

| Deliverable | Purpose | Typical Length |
|:------------|:--------|:---------------|
| **Diagnostic** | Assess current state, identify issues | 1-5 pages |
| **Benchmark** | Compare to competitors/best practices | 3-10 slides |
| **Strategic Options** | Evaluate paths forward | 10-20 slides |
| **Implementation Plan** | Detail how to execute | 20-50 slides |
| **Final Presentation** | Steering committee deck | 15-30 slides |

### What Makes Consulting Valuable

Clients pay for:

1. **Outside perspective**: Objectivity they can't get internally
2. **Specialized expertise**: Knowledge they don't have
3. **Bandwidth**: Capacity they need temporarily
4. **External validation**: Credibility with boards/investors
5. **Implementation support**: Help making change happen

## Project 1: Company Diagnostic

### What You're Simulating

A quick outside-in assessment—the kind you'd do in the first week of an engagement to understand the client's situation.

### OS Application

| OS Action | How You'll Apply It |
|:----------|:--------------------|
| Diagnose current state | Analyze company performance, market position |
| Define the problem | Identify key strategic challenges |
| Build outside-in fact base | Research using public sources |
| Synthesize to insights | Distill findings into "so what" statements |

### Deliverable: 1-Page Analysis

Your diagnostic should answer:

1. What does this company do?
2. How is it performing (financially, competitively)?
3. What are the key strategic challenges/opportunities?
4. What questions would you want to explore further?

## Project 2: Competitive Benchmark

### What You're Simulating

A competitive analysis—comparing your target company to peers to identify strengths, weaknesses, and opportunities.

### OS Application

| OS Action | How You'll Apply It |
|:----------|:--------------------|
| Build fact base | Research competitors using public data |
| Estimate and bound | Size relative market positions |
| Synthesize | Identify key differentiators and gaps |
| Communicate clearly | Present findings in action-titled slides |

### Deliverable: 3-Slide Deck

Your benchmark should include:

1. **Competitive landscape**: Who are the key players? How do they compare?
2. **Your company's position**: Where does it stand? Strengths/weaknesses?
3. **So what**: What does this mean for strategy?

## Project 3: Value-Add Hypothesis

### What You're Simulating

Opportunity identification—proposing where a consulting engagement could add value.

### OS Application

| OS Action | How You'll Apply It |
|:----------|:--------------------|
| Define the problem | Articulate the strategic gap |
| State a hypothesis | Propose a path forward |
| Articulate WWHTBT | What would have to be true for this to work? |
| Communicate with brevity | Present a clear recommendation |

### Deliverable: 5-Slide Deck

Your value-add should include:

1. **The opportunity**: What's the strategic gap or opportunity?
2. **The hypothesis**: What should the company do?
3. **What would have to be true**: Key assumptions to test
4. **Potential value**: How big is the prize?
5. **Next steps**: How would you investigate further?

## Capstone: Full Strategic Proposal

### What You're Simulating

A full consulting proposal—the kind you'd present to a CEO or board at the end of an engagement.

### OS Application

This is the full OS in action:

| OS Imperative | Capstone Application |
|:--------------|:---------------------|
| Think Clearly | Clear problem definition, structured analysis |
| Get to the Right Answer | Fact-based insights, quantified opportunities |
| Move Work Forward | Project managed well, team coordination |
| Create Impact | Compelling storyline, executive-ready presentation |

### Deliverable: 15-20 Slide Deck + Presentation

Your capstone should include:

1. **Executive Summary**: The answer on one slide
2. **Situation**: Context and problem definition
3. **Analysis**: Key findings from your research
4. **Recommendation**: What should the company do?
5. **Implementation**: How should they execute?
6. **Appendix**: Supporting analyses and data

### Capstone Evaluation Criteria

| Criterion | Weight | What We're Looking For |
|:----------|:------:|:-----------------------|
| Problem Definition | 15% | Clear, well-framed strategic question |
| Analysis Quality | 25% | Rigorous, fact-based, insightful |
| Recommendation | 20% | Actionable, supported by evidence |
| Communication | 20% | Clear storyline, executive-ready slides |
| Presentation | 15% | Confident delivery, handles questions |

## Building Consulting Skills

### Outside-In Research

Sources to master:

### Slide Design Principles

| Principle | Application |
|:----------|:------------|
| Action titles | Every title states a conclusion |
| One message | Each slide makes one point |
| Visual hierarchy | Most important information stands out |
| Annotations | Call out key data points |
| Source everything | Build credibility with citations |

### Presenting to Executives

1. **Start with the answer**: Don't build suspense
2. **Be confident**: Own your recommendation
3. **Anticipate questions**: Prepare for pushback
4. **Stay flexible**: Be willing to dive deep or stay high
5. **Know your backup**: Have appendix ready
