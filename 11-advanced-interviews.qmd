# Advanced Interview Preparation

By this point, you've learned case fundamentals and practiced several cases. This chapter covers advanced techniques for case interviews and the behavioral interview—the other half of consulting recruiting.

## Advanced Case Techniques

### Handling Ambiguity

Real consulting problems—and advanced cases—are messier than textbook examples. When a case feels unclear:

1. **Acknowledge the ambiguity** – "This is a complex situation with multiple possible angles."
2. **State your assumptions** – "I'm going to assume X and Y. Does that align with your expectations?"
3. **Proceed with a hypothesis** – "My initial hypothesis is... Let me test that."
4. **Stay flexible** – Be ready to pivot when you learn more

The interviewer wants to see how you handle uncertainty—not whether you have the perfect answer from the start.

### Non-Standard Cases

Beyond classic profitability and market entry:

**Public sector cases:**
- Different success metrics (impact vs. profit)
- Political and stakeholder considerations
- Budget constraints

**Non-profit cases:**
- Mission vs. financial sustainability
- Donor and beneficiary dynamics
- Scale and efficiency trade-offs

**Unusual industries:**
- Don't panic—apply first principles
- Ask clarifying questions about the business model
- Use the same structured thinking

### Candidate-Led vs. Interviewer-Led

**Interviewer-led cases** (more common at McKinsey):
- The interviewer guides you through specific questions
- Less framework building, more rapid-fire analysis
- Focus on quick, clear answers to each question

**Candidate-led cases** (more common at BCG/Bain):
- You drive the case forward
- Build your framework, then systematically work through it
- Take more ownership of direction

Know which style each firm uses and practice accordingly.

### Real-Time Synthesis

Throughout the case, periodically synthesize:

> "Let me step back. We've learned that revenue is declining due to volume loss in the core segment, driven by a new competitor. Costs are stable. This suggests we should focus on competitive response rather than cost cutting. Does that align with your read?"

This shows you're maintaining the through-line, not just answering individual questions.

### Handling Curveballs

When the interviewer throws something unexpected:

1. **Don't panic** – Take a breath
2. **Buy time if needed** – "That's an interesting twist. Let me think for a moment."
3. **Apply first principles** – What would logically follow?
4. **State your thinking** – Walk through your reasoning

The curveball tests your composure as much as your analysis.

## The Behavioral Interview

Case interviews assess problem-solving. Behavioral interviews assess everything else: leadership, teamwork, resilience, motivation.

### What Firms Are Evaluating

| Dimension | What They're Looking For |
|-----------|-------------------------|
| **Leadership** | Can you influence others? Do you take initiative? |
| **Teamwork** | Do you collaborate effectively? Can you handle conflict? |
| **Achievement** | Do you have a track record of impact? |
| **Resilience** | How do you handle setbacks and pressure? |
| **Motivation** | Why consulting? Why this firm? Is it authentic? |
| **Judgment** | Do you make sound decisions? Do you learn from mistakes? |

### The PARADE Framework

Structure your behavioral stories using PARADE:

| Element | Purpose | Time |
|---------|---------|------|
| **P**roblem | Set the context and challenge | 15% |
| **A**ction | What you specifically did | 40% |
| **R**easoning | Why you made those choices | 15% |
| **A**nswer | The outcome/result | 15% |
| **D**evelopment | What you learned | 10% |
| **E**xtension | How you'd apply this in consulting | 5% |

### Building Your Story Bank

Develop 8-10 stories that cover common themes:

| Theme | Example Prompt |
|-------|---------------|
| Leadership | "Tell me about a time you led a team" |
| Teamwork | "Describe a challenging team situation" |
| Conflict | "Tell me about a disagreement with a colleague" |
| Failure | "Describe a time something didn't go as planned" |
| Achievement | "What's your proudest accomplishment?" |
| Initiative | "Tell me about something you did that wasn't required" |
| Influence | "How have you persuaded someone resistant to change?" |
| Pressure | "Describe a high-stakes situation you navigated" |

### Story Quality Checklist

Good behavioral stories are:

- **Specific** – A real example, not hypothetical
- **Recent** – Ideally within the last 2-3 years
- **Your role** – Focus on what you did, not the team
- **Quantified** – Include numbers where possible
- **Honest** – Don't embellish; interviewers probe

### The "Why Consulting?" Question

This question trips up many candidates. Avoid generic answers.

**Weak answer:**
> "I want to work with smart people on interesting problems."

**Strong answer:**
> "I've realized I'm at my best when solving complex problems with structure and data. In my internship at [company], I noticed I gravitated toward the analytical projects—like when I analyzed our customer churn and presented recommendations to leadership. Consulting lets me do that across industries, which is exciting because I'm still figuring out where I want to specialize long-term. I'm particularly drawn to [firm] because of [specific reason—culture, work type, people you've met]."

Elements of a strong answer:
- Self-awareness about why consulting fits you
- Specific evidence from your experience
- Why this firm specifically
- Authentic, not performative

### The "Why This Firm?" Question

Research matters. Know:

- Recent projects or client work (from case competitions, news, alumni)
- Culture and values (from coffee chats)
- What differentiates them from other firms
- Specific people you've talked to

**Template:**
> "I've been drawn to [firm] for three reasons. First, [something about their work or approach]. Second, [something about culture you've observed]. Third, everyone I've spoken with—including [name]—has reinforced that [specific cultural observation]. That aligns with how I like to work."

## Coachability in Interviews

Interviewers are assessing whether you'll be good to work with. Coachability signals:

### What Coachability Looks Like

- **Taking hints gracefully** – "Good point, let me adjust my approach."
- **Building on feedback** – Incorporate what the interviewer suggests
- **Asking for input** – "I'm thinking of approaching it this way. Does that seem right?"
- **Admitting uncertainty** – "I'm not sure, but here's my hypothesis."

### What Uncoachability Looks Like

- **Defensiveness** – Arguing when redirected
- **Rigidity** – Sticking to your original answer despite hints
- **Overconfidence** – Acting like you have all the answers
- **Not listening** – Missing cues from the interviewer

## Mock Interview Practice

### TA Mock Sessions

Your TA will conduct mock interviews:

- **Casing midterm** – Two full mock cases (Week 10)
- **Casing final** – Rigorous evaluation (Week 15)

### Peer Practice

Exchange mock interviews with classmates:

- Practice both giving and receiving cases
- Provide structured feedback using the rubric
- Simulate real interview conditions (time pressure, professional setting)

### Self-Recording

Record yourself doing cases:

- Listen for filler words ("um," "like")
- Watch for nervous habits
- Check if your structure is clear
- Identify where you get stuck

## Interview Day Tips

### Before the Interview

- Research the firm and interviewer (LinkedIn)
- Review your stories and notes
- Get a good night's sleep
- Eat breakfast; bring water

### During the Interview

- Make eye contact and smile
- Take notes on the case prompt
- Ask for a moment to think when needed
- Thank the interviewer at the end

### After the Interview

- Send a thank-you note within 24 hours
- Reflect on what went well and what to improve
- Don't over-analyze; move on to the next one

## Practice Exercise

1. **Write out 3 behavioral stories** using the PARADE framework. Practice telling them in 2 minutes each.

2. **Draft your "Why Consulting?"** answer. Have a partner critique it for authenticity and specificity.

3. **Complete 2 mock cases** this week with TAs or peers. Document your areas for improvement.
