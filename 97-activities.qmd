## 1. Th Jan 8 — Intro to *The Consultant's OS* {#s1}

### Recruiting {#s1-recruiting}

**Why firms hire consultants—and what they look for in you.**

Consulting firms hire because clients need outside expertise, objectivity, or capacity. Understanding *why* firms hire helps you position yourself as someone who fills that need. Today you'll research your target firms to understand their value proposition and hiring criteria.

```
I'm preparing for consulting recruiting. Help me research [FIRM NAME] to understand:

1. What types of clients do they serve and what problems do they solve?
2. What do they say they look for in candidates? (Check their careers page, LinkedIn posts from recruiters, and any public "day in the life" content)
3. What seems to differentiate successful candidates at this firm?

Compile your findings into a 1-page profile I can reference throughout my recruiting process.
```

### Client Work {#s1-client}

**What consultants actually deliver—and selecting your target company.**

Consultants deliver structured thinking, outside-in analysis, and actionable recommendations. Today you'll select a target company you'll analyze throughout the semester and begin understanding what a consultant might deliver for them.

```
I'm selecting a company to analyze for a semester-long consulting project. Help me evaluate [COMPANY NAME] as a potential target:

1. Is this company publicly traded (so I can access 10-Ks, earnings calls, investor presentations)?
2. What industry are they in and who are their main competitors?
3. What strategic challenges or opportunities might a consultant help them address?
4. Is there enough public information available to do meaningful outside-in analysis?

Give me a recommendation on whether this is a good target company for the project.
```

## 2. T Jan 13 — AI as Operating Amplifier {#s2}

### Recruiting {#s2-recruiting}

**Using AI for firm research and networking preparation.**

AI can dramatically accelerate your recruiting preparation—researching firms, preparing for networking conversations, and organizing your outreach. Today you'll set up AI-assisted workflows for your recruiting process.

```
I have a networking call scheduled with [NAME], a [TITLE] at [FIRM]. Help me prepare:

1. Research this person's background (LinkedIn, any articles/podcasts, their career path)
2. Research the firm's recent news, deals, or thought leadership
3. Generate 5 thoughtful questions I could ask that show I've done my homework
4. Identify 2-3 potential points of connection based on their background and mine: [BRIEF BIO]

Format this as a one-page prep sheet I can review before my call.
```

### Client Work {#s2-client}

**Introduction to Claude Code for consulting analysis.**

Claude Code is your AI-powered research and analysis assistant. Today you'll learn the basics of using it for consulting work—from gathering data to structuring analysis.

```
I'm learning to use AI for consulting analysis. For my target company [COMPANY NAME], help me:

1. Find and summarize their most recent annual report (10-K) key points
2. Identify their stated strategy and priorities from recent earnings calls
3. List 3-5 key metrics I should track for this company
4. Suggest what additional sources I should gather for a complete fact base

Walk me through your process so I understand how to do this research systematically.
```

---

## 3. Th Jan 15 — AI as Operating Amplifier {#s3}

### Recruiting {#s3-recruiting}

**AI-assisted company research workshop.**

Building systematic research skills using AI. Today you'll create comprehensive profiles of your target firms.

```
Create a detailed research profile for [FIRM NAME] covering:

**Firm Overview**
- Size, revenue, number of consultants, office locations
- Practice areas and industry specializations
- Recent news, deals, or strategic moves

**Culture & Values**
- What they say about their culture
- What current/former employees say (Glassdoor themes, LinkedIn posts)
- How they describe their ideal candidate

**Recruiting Process**
- Timeline and key dates
- Interview format (how many rounds, case vs. fit emphasis)
- Any unique aspects of their process

**My Fit Assessment**
- Where I'm strong relative to what they want
- Where I have gaps to address
- Key stories/experiences I should highlight

Format as a 2-page reference document.
```

### Client Work {#s3-client}

**Claude Code hands-on: analysis workflows.**

Practice building structured analysis workflows. Today you'll create a reusable template for company analysis.

```
Help me create a structured analysis template for [COMPANY NAME] that I can update throughout the semester. Include sections for:

1. **Company Snapshot**: Industry, size, business model, key products/services
2. **Financial Performance**: Revenue, growth, margins, trends (leave blank for data)
3. **Competitive Position**: Key competitors, market share, differentiation
4. **Strategic Priorities**: What management says they're focused on
5. **Key Challenges**: Problems or risks the company faces
6. **Potential Consulting Questions**: Issues a consultant might help address

Create this as a structured document I can fill in and update.
```

## 4. T Jan 20 — Diagnose {#s4}

### Recruiting {#s4-recruiting}

**Diagnose firm hiring needs—what do they actually look for?**

Before you can position yourself effectively, you need to diagnose what firms *actually* want—not just what they say. This means analyzing patterns in who they hire, what skills they emphasize, and what gaps they're trying to fill.

```
Help me diagnose what [FIRM NAME] actually looks for in candidates:

1. Analyze 5-10 LinkedIn profiles of recent hires (analysts/associates in the last 2 years). What patterns do you see in:
   - Educational background
   - Prior work experience
   - Skills and certifications
   - Extracurricular involvement

2. Compare their stated criteria (from careers page) to the actual profiles of people they hired. Any gaps or surprises?

3. What does this tell me about what they *really* value vs. what they *say* they value?

4. Based on this diagnosis, where am I strong and where do I have gaps?

My background: [BRIEF SUMMARY OF YOUR EXPERIENCE/EDUCATION]
```

### Client Work {#s4-client}

**Diagnose a company's strategic situation.**

Diagnosis comes before prescription. Before defining problems or recommending solutions, you need to understand *what's actually happening* and *why*. Today you'll diagnose your target company's current state.

```
Help me diagnose the current strategic situation for [COMPANY NAME]:

**What's Happening (Symptoms)**
1. What are the observable facts about their performance? (Revenue trends, market share, stock price, operational metrics)
2. What are industry analysts and news sources saying about them?
3. What is management saying in earnings calls about their situation?

**Why It's Happening (Root Causes)**
4. What external factors (market, competition, regulation) might explain these symptoms?
5. What internal factors (strategy, operations, capabilities) might explain them?
6. Are there patterns or anomalies that suggest deeper issues?

**Diagnostic Summary**
Synthesize into a 1-paragraph diagnosis: "Company X is experiencing [symptoms] primarily because [root causes]."
```

---

## 5. Th Jan 22 — Diagnose {#s5}

### Recruiting {#s5-recruiting}

**Self-assessment: diagnosing your fit gaps.**

Turn the diagnostic lens on yourself. Where are you strong vs. weak relative to what consulting firms want? Honest self-diagnosis is essential for targeting your preparation.

```
Help me conduct an honest self-assessment for consulting recruiting:

**My Background**
[Provide: Major, GPA, work experience, leadership roles, technical skills, relevant projects]

**Diagnostic Questions**
1. Based on what top consulting firms look for, rate me (Strong/Average/Gap) on:
   - Academic credentials
   - Leadership experience
   - Analytical/quantitative skills
   - Communication skills
   - Industry knowledge
   - "Interesting" factor / unique experiences

2. For each "Gap" area, what's the root cause? (Lack of experience? Lack of evidence? Wrong framing?)

3. Which gaps are addressable in [X months] before recruiting, and which are harder to change?

4. What's my honest overall positioning: "I'm a [strong/competitive/stretch] candidate for [firm types] because [reasons]"

Be direct—I need honest feedback, not encouragement.
```

### Client Work {#s5-client}

**Root cause analysis: why is performance what it is?**

Move from symptoms to causes. Don't stop at "revenue is declining"—ask *why* until you reach actionable root causes.

```
Help me conduct root cause analysis for [COMPANY NAME]:

Starting symptom: [STATE THE KEY PERFORMANCE ISSUE YOU IDENTIFIED]

**Five Whys Analysis**
Walk through at least 5 levels of "why" to get to root causes:
- Why is [symptom] happening?
- Why is [first-level cause] happening?
- (Continue until you reach actionable root causes)

**Alternative Hypotheses**
What are other possible explanations for the same symptom? (Generate at least 3 alternative root cause hypotheses)

**Evidence Check**
What evidence would confirm or refute each hypothesis? What data would I need?

**Root Cause Summary**
Based on available evidence, what's the most likely root cause and why?
```

---

## 6. T Jan 27 — Define {#s6}

### Recruiting {#s6-recruiting}

**Define the gap: "you now" → "hireable you."**

A problem is a gap between current state and desired state. Define specifically what needs to change for you to be a strong candidate.

```
Help me define my recruiting "problem" as a gap:

**Current State (Me Now)**
[Summarize your self-assessment: key strengths and gaps]

**Desired State (Hireable Me)**
Based on what [TARGET FIRMS] want, what does a strong candidate look like?

**Gap Definition**
Write a clear problem statement: "To be competitive for [firm type], I need to close gaps in [specific areas], demonstrated by [specific evidence/achievements]."

**Success Criteria**
How will I know when I've closed each gap? What's the measurable target?

**Constraints**
- Time available: [X months until applications]
- Resources: [What I have access to]
- Non-negotiables: [Things I can't or won't change]

Make sure my problem statement is specific, measurable, and doesn't presuppose a solution.
```

### Client Work {#s6-client}

**Define the client's problem: current vs. desired performance.**

Help your target company articulate their problem clearly. What's the gap between where they are and where they want to be?

```
Help me define the core strategic problem for [COMPANY NAME]:

**Current State**
Based on my diagnosis, summarize: Where is the company today? (Performance, position, capabilities)

**Desired State**
Based on management's stated goals, analyst expectations, or competitive benchmarks: Where do they want/need to be?

**Gap Definition**
Write a clear problem statement: "[Company] is currently [current state] but needs to [desired state]. The gap is [quantify if possible]."

**Problem Statement Quality Check**
- Is it specific (not vague)?
- Is it measurable (we'll know when it's solved)?
- Does it state the gap clearly?
- Does it avoid presupposing a solution?

If not, refine the problem statement.
```

---

## 7. Th Jan 29 — Frame {#s7}

### Recruiting {#s7-recruiting}

**Frame your recruiting decision set—what's in/out of scope.**

Framing means being explicit about your choices, constraints, and what you're *not* pursuing. This prevents wasted effort and creates focus.

```
Help me frame my consulting recruiting strategy:

**Decision Set**
What firms am I actually targeting? Be specific:
- Tier 1 targets (dream firms):
- Tier 2 targets (strong fit):
- Tier 3 targets (backup options):

**Explicitly Out of Scope**
What am I NOT pursuing this cycle, and why?
- Firm types I'm excluding:
- Geographies I'm excluding:
- Roles I'm excluding:

**Constraints**
- Timeline: [Key dates and deadlines]
- Resources: [Time available per week, budget for travel, etc.]
- Must-haves: [Non-negotiables in an offer]

**Success Criteria**
What does "success" look like for this recruiting cycle? (Be specific: # of interviews? Offer from X tier?)

**Trade-offs I'm Making**
What am I giving up by focusing this way? Am I comfortable with that?
```

### Client Work {#s7-client}

**Frame the client's decision—success criteria and constraints.**

Before solving, be clear about what you're solving for. What's the decision to be made? What are the constraints? What's out of scope?

```
Help me frame the strategic decision for [COMPANY NAME]:

**Decision Statement**
What decision does the company need to make? Frame as: "Should the company [option A] or [option B] or [option C]?"

**Success Criteria**
How should they evaluate options? What matters most?
- Financial criteria (ROI threshold, payback period)
- Strategic criteria (market position, competitive advantage)
- Operational criteria (feasibility, risk)
- Rank these: What's the primary criterion?

**Constraints**
- Budget/investment limits
- Timeline requirements
- Organizational constraints (capabilities, culture, politics)
- External constraints (regulatory, competitive)

**Scope**
- In scope: [What we're analyzing]
- Out of scope: [What we're explicitly NOT addressing, and why]

**Key Stakeholders**
Who needs to be convinced? What do they care about?
```

## 8. T Feb 3 — Hypothesize & WWHTBT {#s8}

### Recruiting {#s8-recruiting}

**State your Day-1 hypothesis: "I'm the right hire because..."**

Don't wait for certainty to form a view. State your hypothesis about why you're a good fit, then test it.

```
Help me develop my recruiting hypothesis—my core value proposition:

**My Hypothesis**
Complete this statement with specifics: "I'm the right hire for [FIRM TYPE] because I bring:
1. [Distinctive strength #1 with evidence]
2. [Distinctive strength #2 with evidence]
3. [Distinctive strength #3 with evidence]

...and I'm a fit because [cultural/values alignment]."

**Testing the Hypothesis**
For each claim:
- What evidence supports it?
- What would disprove it?
- How will networking conversations test it?

**What Would Have to Be True**
For my hypothesis to be correct:
1. [Critical assumption #1]
2. [Critical assumption #2]
3. [Critical assumption #3]

Which of these am I most uncertain about?

**Refining**
Based on this analysis, should I adjust my hypothesis? What's my sharpened value proposition?
```

### Client Work {#s8-client}

**State a Day-1 hypothesis: "The company should do X because..."**

Form a provisional recommendation early. This focuses your analysis on what matters.

```
Help me develop a Day-1 hypothesis for [COMPANY NAME]:

Based on my diagnosis and problem definition, my initial hypothesis is:
"[Company] should [specific action] because [reasoning]."

**Supporting Logic**
Why might this be the right answer?
1. [Reason #1]
2. [Reason #2]
3. [Reason #3]

**What Would Have to Be True**
For this hypothesis to be correct:
1. [Critical assumption about the market]
2. [Critical assumption about the company's capabilities]
3. [Critical assumption about implementation feasibility]
4. [Critical assumption about financial impact]

**Disconfirming Evidence**
What evidence would make me abandon this hypothesis?

**Alternative Hypotheses**
What are 2-3 other hypotheses I should also consider?

This is my starting point—I'll refine it as I gather more evidence.
```

---

## 9. Th Feb 5 — MECE & Prioritization {#s9}

### Recruiting {#s9-recruiting}

**Structure your resume with MECE proof points.**

Your resume should be MECE: each bullet is distinct (mutually exclusive) and together they cover your key selling points (collectively exhaustive). No overlaps, no gaps.

```
Help me MECE-structure my resume for consulting:

**My Key Experiences**
[List your main resume items: jobs, projects, leadership roles]

**MECE Analysis**
1. Map each bullet to a consulting competency:
   - Analytical/Problem-solving
   - Leadership/Initiative
   - Communication/Influence
   - Teamwork/Collaboration
   - Results/Impact

2. Check for MECE:
   - Overlaps: Are any bullets saying the same thing?
   - Gaps: Are any key competencies missing?

3. For each bullet, ensure it has:
   - Action verb (Led, Analyzed, Developed...)
   - Scope (size of team, budget, project)
   - Impact (quantified result)

**Revised Bullets**
Rewrite my top 5 bullets to be MECE and impactful.

**Gap Fillers**
If I have competency gaps, what experiences could I add or reframe?
```

### Client Work {#s9-client}

**Build a MECE issue tree to test your hypothesis.**

Break your hypothesis into testable components that are mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive.

```
Help me build a MECE issue tree for my hypothesis about [COMPANY NAME]:

**Hypothesis**: [Your Day-1 hypothesis]

**Issue Tree Structure**
Break this into 3-4 main branches (MECE at each level):

Branch 1: [First major question to answer]
  - Sub-issue 1.1
  - Sub-issue 1.2
  - Sub-issue 1.3

Branch 2: [Second major question]
  - Sub-issue 2.1
  - Sub-issue 2.2

Branch 3: [Third major question]
  - Sub-issue 3.1
  - Sub-issue 3.2

**MECE Check**
- Are the branches mutually exclusive (no overlaps)?
- Are they collectively exhaustive (nothing missing)?
- Is each level MECE?

**Prioritization**
Which branches/issues are most critical to test first? (Highest uncertainty + highest impact on the answer)

**Exclusion (The "So What" Test)**
For each low-priority branch, ask: "If I knew the answer, would it change my recommendation?"
- Which issues should I explicitly NOT analyze? Why?
- What analyses would be interesting but wouldn't change the decision?
- State what's out of scope and why.

Visualize the prioritized issue tree, marking which branches are in scope vs. explicitly excluded.
```

## 10. T Feb 10 — Outside-In {#s10}

### Recruiting {#s10-recruiting}

**Research firms, roles, and people before outreach.**

Never go into a conversation cold. Outside-in research on firms and people shows respect and creates better conversations.

```
I'm preparing to network with people at [FIRM NAME]. Help me build an outside-in research package:

**Firm Research**
1. Recent news (last 3 months): deals, announcements, thought leadership
2. Strategic priorities: what is leadership saying about firm direction?

```

---

## 11. Th Feb 12 — Outside-In {#s11}

### Recruiting {#s11-recruiting}

**Trust Equation and smoothie chat preparation.**

Networking is about building trust, not extracting information. The Trust Equation helps: Trust = (Credibility + Reliability + Intimacy) / Self-Orientation. Keep self-orientation low.

```
I have a networking conversation with [NAME] at [FIRM] coming up. Help me prepare using the Trust Equation:

**Building Credibility**
- What can I share that shows I know what I'm talking about?
- What thoughtful observations about the firm/industry can I offer?
- How do I demonstrate I've done my homework without showing off?

**Building Reliability**
- How do I follow through on this conversation? (Follow-up, thank you, etc.)
- What commitments should I make and keep?

**Building Intimacy**
- What genuine curiosity do I have about their experience?
- What personal elements can I appropriately share?
- How do I make this a real conversation, not an interrogation?

**Reducing Self-Orientation**
- How do I make this about learning, not asking for favors?
- What can I offer them in return?
- How do I avoid the "what can you do for me" vibe?

**Conversation Plan**
Draft a rough flow for a 20-minute coffee chat that builds trust while getting useful information.
```

### Client Work {#s11-client}

**Outside-in research workshop.**

Deep practice on gathering and organizing external data for your target company.

## 12. Th Feb 19 — Quick Math {#s12}

### Recruiting {#s12-recruiting}

**Case interview: market sizing under pressure.**

Market sizing tests your ability to structure, estimate, and calculate under pressure. Practice the mechanics before your real interviews.

```
Let's practice market sizing. Give me a case:

**Market Sizing Question**
[Generate a realistic market sizing question for me to solve]

**My Approach**
I'll walk through:
1. Clarifying the question
2. Choosing an approach (top-down or bottom-up)
3. Identifying key drivers
4. Making explicit assumptions
5. Doing the math
6. Sanity-checking the answer

[I'll provide my answer, then you critique]

**Feedback Areas**
After I answer, give me feedback on:
- Structure and approach
- Reasonableness of assumptions
- Math accuracy
- Communication clarity
- How I handled uncertainty

Then give me another one to practice.
```

### Client Work {#s12-client}

**Estimate opportunity sizes with explicit assumptions.**

Consultants regularly size opportunities with imperfect data. Practice making assumptions explicit and bounding your estimates.

```
Help me size an opportunity for [COMPANY NAME]:

**Opportunity to Size**
[Describe a strategic opportunity relevant to your target company—e.g., entering a new market, launching a new product, improving operational efficiency]

**Sizing Approach**
Walk through:
1. What exactly are we sizing? (Revenue? Profit? Cost savings?)
2. What's the right approach? (Top-down from market size, or bottom-up from unit economics)
3. What are the key drivers?

**Assumptions**
For each assumption:
- State it explicitly
- Provide reasoning
- Note confidence level (high/medium/low)
- Suggest what proxy data might validate it

**Calculation**
Show the math step by step.

**Sensitivity**
What assumptions matter most? If [key assumption] is 2x higher or lower, how does the answer change?

**Bottom Line**
What's the range? "This opportunity is likely [$X to $Y], with the key swing factor being [variable]."
```

---

## 13. T Feb 24 — Synthesize {#s13}

### Recruiting {#s13-recruiting}

**Case interview: driving to a recommendation.**

The case isn't done when you've done the analysis—it's done when you've made a recommendation. Practice synthesizing analysis into a clear answer.

```
Let's practice a full case with synthesis:

**Case Prompt**
[Generate a case interview prompt—profitability, market entry, or M&A]

I'll work through the case, and at the end, I need to deliver a synthesis.

**Synthesis Framework**
Remind me to structure my recommendation as:
1. **Answer first**: "My recommendation is X"
2. **Three supporting reasons**: "For three reasons: First... Second... Third..."
3. **Risks and mitigations**: "The key risk is... which we'd mitigate by..."
4. **Next steps**: "To move forward, I'd recommend..."

**Feedback**
After I deliver my synthesis, critique:
- Was my answer clear and direct?
- Did my reasons support the answer?
- Did I address risks?
- Was I concise (under 2 minutes)?
- Did I sound confident?
```

### Client Work {#s13-client}

**Synthesize research into "so what" insights.**

Data isn't insight. Move from "what we found" to "what it means" to "what we should do."

```
Help me synthesize my research on [COMPANY NAME] into insights:

**My Findings**
[List 5-7 key facts from your outside-in research]

**So What Ladder**
For each finding, climb the ladder:
1. **Data**: What's the fact?
2. **Insight**: What does it mean?
3. **Implication**: What should the company do about it?

**Synthesis**
Combine related insights into 3-4 major themes:
- Theme 1: [Title] — [1-2 sentence synthesis]
- Theme 2: [Title] — [1-2 sentence synthesis]
- Theme 3: [Title] — [1-2 sentence synthesis]

**Bottom Line**
Write a one-paragraph executive summary: "Our analysis of [Company] reveals [key situation]. The most important insight is [key insight], which suggests [implication]. The company should [recommended direction]."

This will form the backbone of my P1 Diagnostic.

|          |                  |             |        |     |

**Workstream Structure**
Group into 2-3 workstreams:
- Workstream 1: [Name] — analyses X, Y, Z
- Workstream 2: [Name] — analyses A, B, C

**Timeline**
Working backward from P2 (Benchmark) and P3 (Value-Add) deadlines:
- What must be done by when?
- What are the dependencies?

**Weekly Priorities**
For the next 4 weeks:
| Week | Must Complete | Nice to Have |
|------|--------------|--------------|
|      |              |              |

**Next Actions**
What are the 3 most important things to do this week?

## 16. Th Mar 5 — Own {#s16}

### Recruiting {#s16-recruiting}

**Own your job search from outreach to offer.**

Ownership means driving your process proactively, not waiting for things to happen. You're the CEO of your recruiting effort.

```
Help me take ownership of my recruiting process:

**Current State Audit**
- Where am I in the process with each target firm?
- What's falling through the cracks?
- Where am I waiting for others vs. driving myself?

**Ownership Checklist**
For each firm, am I:
- [ ] Proactively scheduling networking calls (not waiting to be introduced)?
- [ ] Following up promptly after conversations?
- [ ] Tracking all contacts and conversations?
- [ ] Preparing thoroughly for each interaction?
- [ ] Anticipating next steps before being told?

**Weekly Ownership Review**
Create a template for weekly self-check:
1. What did I commit to last week? Did I do it?
2. What should I have done that I didn't?
3. What am I waiting on? Can I follow up?
4. What's my POW (Plan of the Week)?

**Accountability System**
How will I hold myself accountable? (TA check-ins, peer accountability, etc.)
```

### Client Work {#s16-client}

**Own your analysis from question to answer.**

Don't just complete tasks—own the insight. You're responsible for the answer, not just the spreadsheet.

```
Let me practice ownership by presenting my workstream status:

**My Workstream**: [Area I'm responsible for in my project]

**Status Update** (using structure):
1. **Status**: On track / At risk / Behind — because [reason]
2. **Progress**: What I completed since last week:
   - [Accomplishment with so-what]
   - [Accomplishment with so-what]
3. **Key Findings**: What I'm learning:
   - [Finding and implication]
4. **Issues/Blockers**: What's in my way:
   - [Issue and what I'm doing about it]
5. **Asks**: What I need:
   - [Specific request]
6. **Next Steps**: What I'll do next:
   - [Action by date]

**Self-Critique**
- Am I owning the insight or just completing tasks?
- Am I anticipating what's needed next?
- Where am I waiting vs. driving?
```

## 17. T Mar 10 — Move {#s17}

### Recruiting {#s17-recruiting}

**Case interview: navigating ambiguous prompts.**

Real interviews are ambiguous by design. Practice making progress without complete information.

```
Give me an ambiguous case prompt and help me practice navigating uncertainty:

**Ambiguous Prompt**
[Provide a deliberately vague case prompt]

**My Approach**
I'll practice:
1. Making reasonable assumptions rather than asking for more data
2. Stating assumptions explicitly
3. Building a structure despite ambiguity
4. Moving forward with "best available" thinking

**Rules**
- I can ask max 2 clarifying questions
- For everything else, I must make and state assumptions
- I must produce an answer, not just say "it depends"

**Feedback**
After my answer:
- Did I move forward or get stuck?
- Were my assumptions reasonable?
- Did I state them clearly?
- Did I reach a conclusion?
```

### Client Work {#s17-client}

**Making analytical calls with incomplete data.**

You'll never have perfect data. Practice making calls with what you have while being explicit about uncertainty.

```
Help me practice making analytical calls with incomplete data for [COMPANY NAME]:

**Question**: [Pick an analytical question where you have partial data]

**What I Know**
[List available data points]

**What I Don't Know**
[List missing data]

**Analytical Approach**
1. Make explicit assumptions for unknowns
2. Use proxies where direct data isn't available
3. Build ranges rather than point estimates
4. Identify sensitivity: what assumptions matter most?

**My Call**
"Based on available data, my best estimate is [X]. This assumes [key assumptions]. If [most important assumption] is wrong, the answer could range from [Y] to [Z]."

**Confidence Level**
How confident am I? What would increase my confidence?

**Next Steps**
What additional information would I seek to derisk this call?
```

---

## 18. Th Mar 12 — Manage Up {#s18}

### Recruiting {#s18-recruiting}

**Update your TA on recruiting progress.**

Practice managing up—giving concise updates that surface what your manager needs to know without burying them in detail.

```
Help me prepare a recruiting update for my TA:

**Status Summary** (one sentence)
Overall, my recruiting is [on track / at risk / behind] because [one reason].

**Progress** (3 bullets max)
Since last check-in:
- [Key accomplishment with outcome]
- [Key accomplishment with outcome]
- [Key accomplishment with outcome]

**Issues** (be direct)
The main challenge is: [issue]
I'm addressing it by: [action]
I need help with: [specific ask, if any]

**Upcoming**
In the next 2 weeks:
- [Key priority]
- [Key priority]

**Numbers** (if relevant)
- Networking calls completed: X
- Cases practiced: X
- Applications submitted: X

Keep total update under 1 minute verbal.
```

### Client Work {#s18-client}

**P2 workshop: competitive analysis with incomplete data.**

Build your competitive benchmark despite imperfect information.

```
Help me build my P2 Competitive Benchmark for [COMPANY NAME]:

**Competitors Selected**
[List 2-3 competitors and why you chose them]

**Benchmark Metrics**
For each competitor, I'll compare on:
| Metric | [Target Co] | [Comp 1] | [Comp 2] | Source/Assumption |
|--------|-------------|----------|----------|-------------------|
| Revenue |            |          |          |                   |
| Growth |            |          |          |                   |
| Margin |            |          |          |                   |
| [Other relevant] |  |          |          |                   |

**Data Gaps**
Where I don't have data:
- [Gap]: Using [proxy/assumption] because [reasoning]

**Analysis**
- Where is [Target Company] winning vs. competitors?
- Where is [Target Company] losing?
- What explains the differences?

**Slide Structure**
Help me structure this into 3 slides:
- Slide 1: Competitive landscape overview
- Slide 2: Benchmark comparison
- Slide 3: Strategic implications
```

## 19. T Mar 17 — Storyline {#s19}

### Recruiting {#s19-recruiting}

**PARADE structure for behavioral stories.**

Your behavioral stories need structure. PARADE (Problem, Action, Result, Application, Differentiation, Evidence) helps you tell compelling stories that demonstrate consulting competencies.

```
Help me build a PARADE story for [COMPETENCY - e.g., Leadership, Problem-Solving, Teamwork]:

**The Situation**
[Describe the context - what was happening?]

**PARADE Structure**

**P - Problem/Context**
What was the challenge or situation? (2-3 sentences, set the stakes)

**A - Action**
What specific actions did YOU take? (Not the team - YOU. Be specific.)

**R - Result**
What was the outcome? (Quantify if possible. What changed?)

**A - Application**
How does this demonstrate skills relevant to consulting?

**D - Differentiation**
What made your approach unique? What would others have done differently?

**E - Evidence**
What proof points make this credible? (Numbers, feedback, outcomes)

**Delivery Version**
Now condense this into a 2-minute verbal version that hits the key points without reading a script.

**Self-Critique**
- Is my action clear and specific?
- Is the result quantified?
- Does this show consulting-relevant skills?
```

### Client Work {#s19-client}

**Slide storylines: SCQA structure.**

Great slides tell a story. SCQA (Situation, Complication, Question, Answer) creates narrative tension that makes your analysis compelling.

```
Help me structure a storyline for my [COMPANY NAME] analysis:

**SCQA Framework**

**Situation** (what the audience already knows/agrees with)
[Company] is a [description] company that [current state everyone acknowledges].

**Complication** (what changed, what's the tension)
However, [describe the problem, threat, or change that creates tension].

**Question** (what we need to answer)
The key question is: [Frame the central question this analysis addresses]

**Answer** (our recommendation/insight)
Our analysis shows that [answer-first statement of your key finding/recommendation].

**Supporting Logic**
The answer is supported by three points:
1. [First supporting point]
2. [Second supporting point]
3. [Third supporting point]

**Slide-by-Slide Storyline**
Map this to a deck flow:
- Slide 1: [Title/message]
- Slide 2: [Title/message]
- Slide 3: [Title/message]
...

Each slide title should be an action title (a sentence, not a label).
```

---

## 20. Th Mar 19 — Storyline {#s20}

### Recruiting {#s20-recruiting}

**PARADE workshop: multiple stories.**

Build out your full story bank across different competencies.

```
Help me develop stories for my full PARADE bank:

**Story 1: Leadership/Initiative**
Situation: [Brief description]
[Walk through PARADE]

**Story 2: Problem-Solving**
Situation: [Brief description]
[Walk through PARADE]

**Story 3: Teamwork/Collaboration**
Situation: [Brief description]
[Walk through PARADE]

**Story 4: Overcoming Challenge/Failure**
Situation: [Brief description]
[Walk through PARADE]

**Story 5: Achievement/Impact**
Situation: [Brief description]
[Walk through PARADE]

**Cross-Check**
- Do my stories cover different experiences (not all from one job)?
- Are results quantified?
- Do actions show MY contribution, not just the team's?
- Can each be delivered in under 2 minutes?

**Tagging**
For each story, note which common behavioral questions it could answer.
```

### Client Work {#s20-client}

**Building persuasive slide decks.**

Practice converting analysis into compelling slides.

```
Help me build persuasive slides for my [COMPANY NAME] analysis:

**Content to Convert**
[Paste key findings from your analysis]

**Slide Creation**
For each key point, create:

**Slide [N]**
- **Action Title**: [One sentence that states the conclusion - not "Market Analysis" but "Market is growing 8% driven by premium segment"]
- **Visual**: [What chart/table/graphic tells this story best?]
- **Supporting Data**: [What numbers/facts appear on the slide?]
- **Source**: [Where did this data come from?]
- **So What**: [Why does this matter for the overall argument?]

**Slide Flow Check**
Reading just the titles in order, does the story make sense?

**Design Principles Check**
- One message per slide?
- Answer-first titles?
- Clean visuals (not cluttered)?
- Source citations?
```

## 21. T Mar 24 — Brevity {#s21}

### Recruiting {#s21-recruiting}

**Behavioral delivery: crisp, confident 2-minute answers.**

Content is only half the battle. Practice delivering your stories with confidence, brevity, and energy.

```
Let's practice behavioral interview delivery:

**Practice Session Format**

1. You ask me a behavioral question
2. I deliver my answer (targeting 90-120 seconds)
3. You give me feedback on:
   - Length (too long? too short?)
   - Structure (was PARADE clear?)
   - Confidence (did I sound certain?)
   - Specificity (concrete or vague?)
   - Energy (engaging or flat?)

**Common Questions to Practice**
- "Tell me about a time you led a team through a challenge."
- "Describe a situation where you had to solve an ambiguous problem."
- "Tell me about a failure and what you learned."
- "Give me an example of when you influenced someone without authority."
- "What's your greatest accomplishment?"

**Delivery Tips to Reinforce**
- Start strong (no "um, so, like...")
- State the bottom line early
- Be specific (names, numbers, dates)
- End cleanly (no trailing off)
- Maintain eye contact (look at camera if virtual)

Let's do 3-4 rounds.
```

### Client Work {#s21-client}

**Present recommendations concisely—lead with the answer.**

Practice presenting your analysis answer-first, with executive brevity.

```
Help me practice presenting my [COMPANY NAME] analysis with brevity:

**The 30-Second Version**
If interrupted after 30 seconds, what must I communicate?
[Write the essential message in 3 sentences or less]

**The 2-Minute Version**
Full recommendation with structure:
- Answer: [10 sec]
- Three reasons: [60 sec - 20 each]
- Risks: [20 sec]
- Next steps: [20 sec]

**Practice Script**
Write out my 2-minute presentation, then:
- Cut any word that doesn't earn its place
- Replace jargon with plain language
- Make numbers memorable (round, compare to something familiar)

**Critique**
After I deliver:
- Did I lead with the answer?
- Were my points distinct and clear?
- Did I stay under 2 minutes?
- Did I sound confident?
```

---

## 22. Th Mar 26 — Brevity {#s22}

### Recruiting {#s22-recruiting}

**Behavioral practice session.**

Intensive practice delivering behavioral stories under interview conditions.

```
Run a behavioral interview simulation:

```

### Client Work {#s22-client}

**P3 workshop: executive-level presentations.**

Bring your Value-Add Hypothesis together into a compelling 5-slide deck.

```
Help me build my P3 Value-Add Hypothesis deck for [COMPANY NAME]:

**Deck Structure**

**Slide 1: Executive Summary**
- One-sentence value-add hypothesis

## 23. T Mar 31 — Trust {#s23}

### Recruiting {#s23-recruiting}

**Fit interviews: demonstrating character and judgment.**

Fit interviews assess whether you're someone people want to work with. This is about judgment, values, and cultural fit.

```
Help me prepare for fit/behavioral interview moments that test character and judgment:

**Common Judgment Questions**
- "Tell me about a time you faced an ethical dilemma."
- "Describe a situation where you disagreed with your boss."
- "How do you handle working with difficult people?"
- "Tell me about a time you made a mistake. What did you do?"

**Preparing Authentic Answers**
For each, I need stories that show:
- Self-awareness
- Integrity
- Humility
- Growth mindset

**Practice Questions**
Ask me 3 judgment-testing questions and give me feedback on:
- Do I come across as genuine?
- Do I take appropriate responsibility?
- Do I show growth and learning?
- Do I avoid blaming others?

**Cultural Fit Signals**
What signals suggest good vs. poor cultural fit at consulting firms?
How do I demonstrate alignment without being fake?
```

### Client Work {#s23-client}

**Building trust with stakeholders.**

Analysis matters, but trust matters more. Practice building trust in how you communicate.

```
Help me think about building trust with hypothetical stakeholders for my [COMPANY NAME] project:

**Stakeholder Analysis**
If this were a real engagement, who would the stakeholders be?
| Stakeholder | What They Care About | Potential Concerns | How to Build Trust |
|-------------|---------------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| CEO         |                     |                   |                   |
| CFO         |                     |                   |                   |
| [Other]     |                     |                   |                   |

**Trust Equation Application**
For each stakeholder, how would I build:
- Credibility (know my stuff)
- Reliability (do what I say)
- Intimacy (genuine connection)
- Low self-orientation (focused on their success)

**Communication Style**
How would I adjust my presentation style for different stakeholders?

**Anticipating Concerns**
What pushback might each stakeholder have?
How would I address it without being defensive?
```

---

## 24. Th Apr 2 — Tailor {#s24}

### Recruiting {#s24-recruiting}

**Handling difficult fit questions.**

Some questions are designed to test you. Practice staying composed and authentic under pressure.

```
Let's practice difficult fit questions:

**Hard Questions**
- "Why should we hire you over other candidates?"
- "What's your biggest weakness?"
- "Why didn't you get into [higher-ranked school]?"
- "I see a gap in your resume. What happened?"
- "What would your harshest critic say about you?"
- "You don't have [X experience]. Why should we consider you?"

**Practice Format**
Ask me these one at a time. For each:
- I'll answer
- You'll push back or probe
- I'll respond to the push
- You'll give feedback

**Evaluation**
- Did I stay composed?
- Was I authentic (not rehearsed/fake)?
- Did I own my story without being defensive?
- Did I redirect to strengths appropriately?

**Red Flags to Avoid**
- Blaming others
- Being defensive
- Giving non-answers
- Being too rehearsed
- Showing insecurity
```

### Client Work {#s24-client}

**Prewiring and navigating difficult conversations.**

Great consultants prewire recommendations and handle pushback gracefully using Yes-No-Yes.

```
Help me practice navigating difficult conversations:

**Scenario**
Imagine presenting my [COMPANY NAME] recommendation to a skeptical executive:

My recommendation: [Your P3 recommendation]
Their likely concern: [What objection might they raise?]

**Prewiring Practice**
How would I share my findings with this stakeholder BEFORE the meeting to get their input and reduce surprises?

**Yes-No-Yes Framework**
For the likely objection:
- **Yes**: Acknowledge their concern legitimately
- **No**: Deliver the difficult message directly
- **Yes**: Offer a path forward

**Practice Script**
Write out how I would handle this objection using Yes-No-Yes.

**Additional Difficult Scenarios**
- "Your analysis is wrong because [challenge to data]"
- "We tried this before and it didn't work"
- "This isn't a priority right now"

How would I handle each with poise?
```

**Feedback Received**
[List feedback you received]

**Processing Feedback**
For each piece:
1. Is this valid? (Do I agree/disagree?)
2. Is this actionable? (Can I change it?)
3. What specific change will I make?

**Improvement Plan**
| Feedback Area | Specific Change | How I'll Practice |
|--------------|-----------------|-------------------|
|              |                 |                   |

**Seeking Better Feedback**
What specific questions should I ask after mock interviews?
- Not: "How did I do?"

**Demonstrating Coachability**
How do I show in interviews that I'm coachable?
- Responding to real-time feedback
- Showing growth mindset
- Asking good questions
```

### Client Work {#s25-client}

**Revise deliverables based on input.**

Practice taking feedback on your analysis and improving rapidly.

**Feedback Analysis**
| Feedback | Valid? | How to Address |
|----------|--------|----------------|
|          |        |                |

**Revised Content**
For each valid point, show:
- Original version
- Revised version
- Why the revision is better

**Iteration Mindset**
- What patterns do I see in the feedback I receive?
- What should I check BEFORE submitting next time?
- How can I build in review time for iteration?

**Version Control**
What changed from v1 to v2? Can I articulate the improvement?
```

## 26. Th Apr 9 — Coordinate {#s26}

### Recruiting {#s26-recruiting}

**No activity this session—focus on Client Work.**

Use this time to continue case practice and behavioral prep independently.

### Client Work {#s26-client}

**Capstone team coordination.**

Practice coordinating as a team to deliver a unified narrative.
