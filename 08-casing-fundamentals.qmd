# Case Interview Fundamentals

The case interview is the signature consulting interview format. It tests your ability to structure ambiguous problems, work with data, and communicate clearly under pressure. This chapter covers the fundamentals you need before practicing live cases.

## What Firms Are Evaluating

Case interviews assess four core dimensions:

| Dimension | What They're Looking For |
|-----------|-------------------------|
| **Problem Solving** | Can you structure ambiguity? Do you think logically? Can you identify what matters? |
| **Quantitative Skills** | Can you work with numbers accurately and quickly? Do you interpret data correctly? |
| **Communication** | Are you clear and structured? Do you synthesize effectively? Can you explain your thinking? |
| **Leadership Presence** | Are you poised? Do you engage the interviewer? Would clients trust you? |

No one expects perfection. Interviewers want to see how you think, how you handle uncertainty, and whether you'd be effective on a client team.

## Anatomy of a Case

A typical case interview flows through several phases:

### 1. Opening (2-3 minutes)

The interviewer presents the problem:

> "Our client is a regional grocery chain. Profits have declined 15% over the past two years. The CEO wants to understand why and what to do about it."

Your job:

- **Listen carefully** – Take notes
- **Clarify** – Ask 2-3 questions to understand scope and constraints
- **Restate** – Confirm your understanding of the problem

**Good clarifying questions:**

- "When you say profits, do you mean operating profit or net income?"
- "Is the decline happening across all stores or concentrated in certain regions?"
- "Are there any options the CEO has already ruled out?"

### 2. Structuring (3-5 minutes)

After clarifying, take time to build your framework:

> "I'd like to take a minute to structure my approach."

Then present a MECE framework that addresses the problem. Your framework should:

- **Be tailored** – Not a generic template
- **Be MECE** – Mutually exclusive, collectively exhaustive
- **Prioritize** – Indicate where you'd start and why
- **State a hypothesis** – What do you think is driving the issue?

**Example structure for a profitability case:**

> "Profit decline could come from revenue issues or cost issues. On revenue, I'd look at price changes and volume changes. On costs, I'd separate fixed and variable costs. Given that the decline is recent and affects a grocery chain, my initial hypothesis is that it's likely volume-driven, possibly from competitive pressure. I'd start by understanding the volume trends."

### 3. Analysis (15-20 minutes)

The interviewer guides you through data and analysis. You might:

- **Analyze exhibits** – Charts, tables, data
- **Do calculations** – Market sizing, profitability math, breakeven
- **Explore hypotheses** – Testing your initial thinking
- **Pivot** – Adjusting your approach based on new information

Throughout, you should:

- **Think out loud** – Share your reasoning
- **Structure your work** – Show organized calculations
- **Synthesize frequently** – "So what we're seeing is..."
- **Be coachable** – Take hints and redirect gracefully

### 4. Recommendation (2-3 minutes)

At the end, you'll be asked for your recommendation:

> "The CEO is about to walk in. What would you tell her?"

Your recommendation should:

- **Lead with the answer** – "I recommend X"
- **Support with 2-3 reasons** – "Because of A, B, and C"
- **Acknowledge risks** – "The key risk is..."
- **Suggest next steps** – "To validate this, we should..."

## Common Case Types

### Profitability

> "Why has profit declined? How do we improve it?"

**Structure:** Revenue (price × volume) vs. Costs (fixed + variable)

### Market Entry

> "Should the client enter a new market?"

**Structure:** Market attractiveness, competitive dynamics, client capabilities, financial implications

### Growth Strategy

> "How can the client grow revenue?"

**Structure:** Organic growth (existing products, new products, new markets) vs. Inorganic (M&A, partnerships)

### Pricing

> "How should the client price a new product?"

**Structure:** Cost-plus, competitive pricing, value-based pricing

### Operations

> "How can the client reduce costs or improve efficiency?"

**Structure:** Process analysis, capacity utilization, supply chain, labor productivity

### M&A

> "Should the client acquire this target?"

**Structure:** Strategic rationale, valuation, synergies, risks, integration

## Building Frameworks

Good frameworks are customized to the specific problem—not templates memorized from case books. Here's how to build them:

### Start with the Question

What specifically are you trying to answer? Your framework should map to that question.

### Think About Drivers

What are the key factors that would influence the answer? Break these into 3-4 buckets.

### Make It MECE

Each bucket should be distinct (no overlap) and together they should cover everything relevant.

### Personalize It

Use language specific to the industry and situation. A framework for a grocery chain should sound different than one for a tech company.

### State Your Hypothesis

What's your initial take on the most likely answer? This shows you're thinking proactively.

## Quantitative Skills

Case interviews test your ability to work with numbers under pressure.

### Mental Math Tips

- **Round aggressively** – $47.3M becomes $50M
- **Break into parts** – 45 × 12 = 45 × 10 + 45 × 2 = 540
- **Know your benchmarks** – Population, percentages, compound growth
- **Verbalize your approach** – "Let me walk you through my calculation..."

### Common Calculations

| Type | Formula |
|------|---------|
| Profit | Revenue - Costs |
| Profit Margin | Profit / Revenue |
| Breakeven | Fixed Costs / (Price - Variable Cost) |
| Market Size | Population × % relevant × usage rate × price |
| Growth Rate | (End - Start) / Start |
| Contribution Margin | Price - Variable Cost |

### Interpreting Exhibits

When shown data:

1. **Read the title** – What is this showing?
2. **Understand the axes** – What's measured and how?
3. **Identify the key insight** – What's the "so what"?
4. **Connect to the case** – How does this inform your hypothesis?

## Communication Throughout

Your communication matters as much as your analysis.

### Thinking Out Loud

Don't go silent. Share your reasoning:

> "I'm looking at this chart and noticing that volumes dropped significantly in Q3. That was when the new competitor opened their store, which suggests competitive pressure is a major factor."

### Structuring Your Response

Use signposting:

> "There are three things I'd want to understand here. First... Second... Third..."

### Synthesizing

Periodically summarize:

> "So what we've learned so far is that the profit decline is primarily driven by volume loss in the metro stores, likely due to competitive entry. The costs side looks stable."

### Handling Mistakes

If you make an error:

- Acknowledge it quickly
- Correct it
- Move on

> "Actually, let me redo that calculation—I think I made an error. The correct number should be..."

## Demonstrating Coachability

Interviewers give hints. Take them.

If the interviewer says:

> "That's an interesting approach. What if we focused more on the cost side?"

This is a redirect. Follow it:

> "Good point. Let me pivot to the cost structure and see what we can learn there."

## Case Practice Plan

To build fluency, you need deliberate practice:

| Week | Focus | Target Cases |
|------|-------|-------------|
| 7-8 | Learn the structure, practice with TA | 2-3 |
| 9-10 | Practice all case types | 4-6 |
| 11-12 | Advanced cases, speed | 4-6 |
| 13-14 | Mock interviews, polish | 2-4 |
| **Total** | | **12-19 cases** |

### Practice Resources

- **TA sessions** – Weekly practice with your pod
- **Peer partners** – Exchange cases with classmates
- **MCA events** – Additional practice opportunities
- **Case books** – McKinsey, BCG, Bain casebooks

### Self-Assessment After Each Case

Ask yourself:

- Did I clarify the problem effectively?
- Was my framework MECE and tailored?
- Did I structure my math clearly?
- Did I synthesize insights effectively?
- Was my recommendation clear and well-supported?
- Where did I struggle? What will I do differently?

## Practice Exercise

Before your first TA case walkthrough:

1. **Watch a sample case** – Find a McKinsey or BCG practice case on YouTube
2. **Pause and structure** – When they present the problem, pause and write your own framework before seeing theirs
3. **Compare** – How did your approach differ? What can you learn?

Come to the case walkthrough ready to try a full case with your pod.
