title: "4. Create Impact with People"
---

**Guiding Question:** Do people understand, trust, and act on this work?

The fourth imperative is where consulting becomes real. Your analysis only creates value if people understand it, believe it, and act on it. This is about communication, trust, and influence.

## Core Actions

### 4.1 Craft a Storyline **(6)** 🔺 {#os-4-1}

*Build a narrative arc from situation to recommendation*

Don't just present findings. Tell a story that leads logically to your recommendation.

| Recruiting Application | Client Work Application |
|:-----------------------|:------------------------|
| Behavioral stories: use PARADE to link your experience to role requirements | Slide storylines: build a narrative arc from situation through analysis to recommendation |

**The Pyramid Principle:**

Start with the answer, then support it with evidence.

```
         [Main Message]
              ↑
    [Key Point 1] [Key Point 2] [Key Point 3]
         ↑           ↑              ↑
    [Evidence]   [Evidence]    [Evidence]
```

**SCQA Structure:**

- **Situation**: Context the audience knows
- **Complication**: What changed or what's the tension?
- **Question**: What do we need to decide?
- **Answer**: Our recommendation

```
:::

### 4.2 Communicate with Executive Brevity **(7)** 🔺 {#os-4-2}

*Lead with the answer, support with evidence*

Executives are busy. Communicate with clarity and concision.

| Recruiting Application | Client Work Application |
|:-----------------------|:------------------------|
| Behavioral delivery: crisp, confident, 2-minute answers | Present recommendations concisely; lead with the answer, support with evidence |

**Executive Communication Principles:**

1. **Lead with the answer**: Don't build to your conclusion
2. **Use action titles**: Every slide title should state a conclusion
3. **One message per slide**: If you can't summarize it, split it
4. **Quantify**: "Significant growth" → "23% growth"
5. **Be explicit about trade-offs**: What are we giving up?

**Action Titles:**

| Weak Title | Action Title |
|:-----------|:-------------|
| "Market Analysis" | "Market is growing 8% annually, driven by premium segment" |
| "Financial Overview" | "Margins have declined 300bps due to rising input costs" |
| "Recommendations" | "Invest $10M in premium refresh to capture 15% market share" |

**The 30-Second Rule:**

If you were interrupted after 30 seconds, would they know your main point? Structure every communication so the answer comes first.

::: {#session-21 .callout-tip collapse="true"}
## Session 21 Activity: Executive Brevity

### Recruiting: Behavioral delivery—crisp 2-minute answers

Practice delivering your behavioral stories with crisp, confident, 2-minute answers.

```bash
Help me practice delivering behavioral stories with executive brevity:

**My Story**
[Paste one of your PARADE stories]

**Delivery Practice**

1. **Time Check**
   - Read the story aloud and time yourself
   - Target: 2-2.5 minutes
   - If over, what can I cut?

2. **Opening Hook**
   - Can I start with a compelling first sentence?
   - Draft 3 alternative openings

3. **Answer-First Structure**
   - Does my story lead with the key point?
   - Rewrite the opening to front-load the result

4. **Crisp Language**
   - Find 5 phrases to tighten
   - Remove filler words and hedging language

**Delivery Feedback**
Rate my story on:
- Clarity (1-5): Is the point obvious?
- Confidence (1-5): Does it sound assured?
- Brevity (1-5): Is every word necessary?
- Impact (1-5): Is it memorable?

What one change would most improve delivery?
```

### Client Work: Present recommendations—30-sec and 2-min versions

Practice presenting your recommendations at different lengths for different contexts.

```bash
Help me practice presenting recommendations at executive length:

**My Recommendation**
[State your key recommendation from your project]

**30-Second Version (Elevator Pitch)**
If I only had 30 seconds with an executive:
- What's the one sentence summary?
- What's the key number or proof point?
- What's the call to action?

Draft my 30-second version:
[Practice]

**2-Minute Version (Status Update)**
If I had 2 minutes in a meeting:
- Opening: Answer first (15 sec)
- Support 1: Key evidence (30 sec)
- Support 2: Key evidence (30 sec)
- Support 3: Key evidence (30 sec)
- Close: Action/next steps (15 sec)

Draft my 2-minute version:
[Practice]

**Feedback**
- Do both versions lead with the answer?
- Is the 30-second version memorable?
- Does the 2-minute version have clear structure?
- What should I cut or emphasize?
```

### 4.3 Tailor to Stakeholders **(7)** 🔺 {#os-4-3}

*Different audiences need different messages*

Different audiences need different messages. Know your stakeholders.

| Recruiting Application | Client Work Application |
|:-----------------------|:------------------------|
| Tailor your story to each firm's values and needs | Tailor presentations to what each stakeholder cares about |

**Stakeholder Mapping:**

| Stakeholder | What They Care About | Potential Concerns |
|:------------|:--------------------|:-------------------|
| CEO | Strategic direction, shareholder value | Will this work? What's the risk? |
| CFO | ROI, cost, financial impact | Can we afford this? What's the payback? |
| COO | Implementation, operations | Can we execute? What resources do we need? |
| Board | Governance, risk, long-term value | Is this the right bet? |

**Tailoring Principles:**

1. Know what each stakeholder cares about
2. Anticipate their questions and concerns
3. Frame recommendations in their terms
4. Address objections before they're raised

::: {#session-24 .callout-tip collapse="true"}
## Session 24 Activity: Tailor & Handle Pushback

### Recruiting: Handle difficult fit questions with poise

Practice handling difficult or unexpected behavioral questions with confidence.

```bash
Help me practice handling difficult fit interview questions:

**Difficult Question Types**
1. Weakness questions: "What's your biggest weakness?"
2. Failure questions: "Tell me about a time you failed"
3. Conflict questions: "Tell me about a time you disagreed with a superior"
4. Pressure questions: "Why should we hire you over other candidates?"
5. Curveball questions: "What would you do if you had unlimited budget?"

**Practice Session**
Give me one difficult question at a time. I'll answer, then get feedback.

**My Response Framework**
For each answer:
- Stay calm and composed
- Answer honestly but strategically
- Show self-awareness and growth
- Keep it brief (1-2 minutes)

**Feedback**
For each response:
- Did I maintain poise?
- Was my answer honest without being damaging?
- Did I show growth or learning?
- What would make this stronger?

**Common Traps**
Help me avoid:
- Being too negative about myself
- Blaming others
- Giving non-answers
- Going too long
```

### Client Work: Prewiring practice; Yes-No-Yes for objections

Practice prewiring stakeholders and handling objections using the Yes-No-Yes framework.

```bash
Help me practice prewiring and handling objections:

**My Recommendation**
[State your key recommendation]

**Stakeholder Mapping**
Who needs to be aligned before presenting?
- Stakeholder 1: [Role, what they care about, likely concerns]
- Stakeholder 2: [Role, what they care about, likely concerns]
- Stakeholder 3: [Role, what they care about, likely concerns]

**Prewiring Plan**
For each stakeholder:
- What will I share with them in advance?
- What questions will I ask to get their input?
- How will I incorporate their feedback?

**Anticipated Objections**
List 3-4 likely objections to your recommendation:
1. [Objection]
2. [Objection]
3. [Objection]

**Yes-No-Yes Responses**
For each objection, prepare a response:

Objection 1: [State objection]
- YES (affirm): [Acknowledge their concern]
- NO (redirect): [Address the issue directly]
- YES (path forward): [Offer constructive way forward]

[Continue for each objection]

**Role Play**
Let's practice: Give me one objection at a time and I'll respond using Yes-No-Yes.
```

### 4.4 Build Trust {#os-4-4}

*Demonstrate judgment, reliability, and empathy*

Trust is the foundation of influence. Without it, even perfect analysis fails.

| Recruiting Application | Client Work Application |
|:-----------------------|:------------------------|
| Fit interviews: demonstrate character, judgment, and cultural fit | Build trust through consistent delivery, honest communication, and genuine care for client success |

**Trust Equation (reminder):**

$$Trust = \frac{Credibility + Reliability + Intimacy}{Self\text{-}Orientation}$$

**Building Trust:**

| Component | How to Build It |
|:----------|:----------------|
| **Credibility** | Know your stuff; admit what you don't know |
| **Reliability** | Do what you say; meet deadlines; follow up |
| **Intimacy** | Listen; remember personal details; be human |
| **Low Self-Orientation** | Focus on their success, not your credit |

::: {#session-23 .callout-tip collapse="true"}
## Session 23 Activity: Build Trust

### Recruiting: Fit interviews—demonstrate character & judgment

Prepare for fit interviews by demonstrating character, judgment, and cultural alignment.

```bash
Help me prepare to demonstrate character and judgment in fit interviews:

**Character Dimensions**
Consulting firms evaluate:
- Integrity: Do you do the right thing?
- Judgment: Do you make good decisions?
- Humility: Can you admit mistakes?
- Resilience: How do you handle adversity?
- Curiosity: Are you genuinely interested in learning?

**Story Mapping**
For each dimension, identify a story that demonstrates it:
- Integrity story: [Brief description]
- Judgment story: [Brief description]
- Humility story: [Brief description]
- Resilience story: [Brief description]
- Curiosity story: [Brief description]

**Cultural Fit Questions**
Prepare for questions like:
- "Why consulting?"
- "Why our firm specifically?"
- "What do you do outside of work?"
- "Tell me about a time you failed"

**Practice Responses**
Let me practice answering fit questions. Give me one at a time and provide feedback on:
- Did I show authentic character?
- Did I demonstrate good judgment?
- Did I come across as someone they'd want on their team?
```

### Client Work: Stakeholder trust—map concerns, apply Trust Equation

Map stakeholder concerns and develop a plan to build trust.

```bash
Help me apply the Trust Equation to key stakeholders:

**Trust Equation Reminder**
Trust = (Credibility + Reliability + Intimacy) / Self-Orientation

**Stakeholder Analysis**
For each key stakeholder in my project:

**Stakeholder 1: [Name/Role]**
- Their primary concerns:
- What they care about most:

Assess my trust components:
- Credibility: How can I show I know what I'm talking about?
- Reliability: How can I demonstrate follow-through?
- Intimacy: How can I connect on a personal level?
- Self-Orientation: How do I show this is about their success?

**Trust-Building Plan**
For each stakeholder:
1. What specific action will increase credibility?
2. What commitment will I make (and keep) to build reliability?
3. What genuine connection can I make to build intimacy?
4. How will I keep self-orientation low?

**Red Flags**
- Where might my credibility be questioned?
- Where have I been unreliable?
- What might make them think I'm self-oriented?

**Improvement Plan**
What's my #1 priority to build more trust with each stakeholder?
```
:::

### 4.5 Prewire Stakeholders {#os-4-5}

*Never surprise decision-makers in a meeting*

Never surprise stakeholders in a meeting. Prewire your recommendations.

| Recruiting Application | Client Work Application |
|:-----------------------|:------------------------|
| Before asking for a referral, build the relationship | Before the steering committee, share findings with key stakeholders individually |

**Prewiring Principles:**

1. **Identify key stakeholders**: Who needs to be aligned?
2. **Meet individually**: Share findings, get reactions
3. **Incorporate feedback**: Adjust recommendations if needed
4. **Build support**: Convert skeptics before the room
5. **No surprises**: Everyone should know what's coming

### 4.6 Navigate Difficult Conversations {#os-4-6}

*Deliver hard messages constructively*

Sometimes you have to tell people things they don't want to hear.

| Recruiting Application | Client Work Application |
|:-----------------------|:------------------------|
| Handle difficult fit questions with poise | Deliver tough messages about performance, strategy, or organization |

**Yes-No-Yes Framework:**

1. **Yes**: Affirm their perspective or concern
2. **No**: Deliver the difficult message directly
3. **Yes**: Offer a path forward or positive framing

**Example:**

- "I understand you've invested heavily in this product line (Yes). The data shows it's not recovering, so we recommend sunsetting it (No). This frees resources to invest in your highest-growth segments (Yes)."

### 4.7 Coordinate as a Team {#os-4-7}

*Present with consistent messaging and smooth handoffs*

In consulting, you rarely present alone. Teams must be aligned.

| Recruiting Application | Client Work Application |
|:-----------------------|:------------------------|
| In group interviews or networking events, coordinate with peers | Present as a team with consistent messaging and smooth handoffs |

**Team Presentation Principles:**

1. **Align on the storyline**: Everyone knows the narrative
2. **Clear handoffs**: Who covers what
3. **Support each other**: No contradictions or surprises
4. **One voice**: Consistent framing and recommendations

::: {#session-26 .callout-tip collapse="true"}
## Session 26 Activity: Coordinate as a Team

### Client Work: Capstone team coordination—unified narrative, handoffs

Coordinate with your capstone team to create a unified presentation with smooth handoffs.

```bash
Help my team coordinate our capstone presentation:

**Team Members**
- [Name 1]: [Role/Section]
- [Name 2]: [Role/Section]
- [Name 3]: [Role/Section]

**Storyline Alignment**
First, let's align on our overall narrative:
- What is our main recommendation?
- What are the 3 key supporting points?
- What's the "so what" for the client?

Does everyone agree on this framing?

**Section Ownership**
Who presents what?
- Opening/Context: [Owner]
- Analysis Section 1: [Owner]
- Analysis Section 2: [Owner]
- Recommendations: [Owner]
- Q&A Lead: [Owner]

**Handoff Planning**
For each transition:
- Transition 1: [Person A] → [Person B]
  - Last sentence from A:
  - First sentence from B:

- Transition 2: [Person B] → [Person C]
  - Last sentence from B:
  - First sentence from C:

**Consistency Check**
Review for alignment:
- Are we using the same terminology?
- Are our numbers consistent across sections?
- Do our recommendations match across speakers?
- Are our action titles telling one coherent story?

**Rehearsal Plan**
- When will we do a full run-through?
- Who will give feedback?
- What's our backup plan if someone loses track?

**Q&A Coordination**
- Who answers what types of questions?
- How do we hand off if the wrong person gets a question?
- What are the 5 hardest questions we might get, and who answers each?
```
:::

### 4.8 Seek Feedback {#os-4-8}

*Constantly improve through input from others*

The best consultants constantly improve through feedback.

| Recruiting Application | Client Work Application |
|:-----------------------|:------------------------|
| After mock interviews, ask for specific feedback and apply it | After presentations and deliverables, ask what could be better |

**Seeking Feedback:**

1. **Ask specifically**: "What's one thing I could improve?"
2. **Listen fully**: Don't defend or explain
3. **Thank them**: Feedback is a gift
4. **Apply it**: Show improvement next time

**Demonstrating Coachability:**

- Before/after examples show growth
- Rapid incorporation of feedback
- Asking for feedback (not waiting for it)
- Openness to being wrong

::: {#session-25 .callout-tip collapse="true"}
## Session 25 Activity: Seek & Apply Feedback

### Client Work: Revise deliverables based on input

Practice incorporating feedback to improve your deliverables.

```bash
Help me revise my deliverable based on feedback:

**My Deliverable**
[Paste or describe your deliverable - slide deck, analysis, memo]

**Feedback Received**
[Paste or summarize feedback from TA, professor, or peers]

**Feedback Triage**
Categorize feedback:
- Must fix (critical issues):
- Should fix (important improvements):
- Could fix (nice to have):

**Revision Plan**
For each "must fix" item:
- Original: [What it was]
- Issue: [What was wrong]
- Revised: [What it should be]
- Why: [How this improves it]

**Quality Check**
After revisions:
- Did I address all critical feedback?
- Did the revisions improve clarity?
- Did I maintain consistency?
- Is it now client-ready?

**Learning for Next Time**
- What will I do differently on my next deliverable?
- What feedback do I want to make sure I never get again?

**Feedback Loop**
Would you review my revisions and confirm they address the original feedback?
```
:::

## Putting It Together

The Create Impact actions flow:

```
Craft Storyline → Communicate Clearly → Tailor to Stakeholders → Build Trust → Prewire → Handle Hard Conversations → Coordinate → Seek Feedback
```

This is where consulting becomes influence, and where careers are made.

## Practice This Week

1. **PARADE story**: Write one behavioral story using the PARADE framework
2. **Action titles**: Take 3 slide titles and rewrite them as action titles
3. **Prewiring exercise**: Plan how you would prewire a controversial recommendation
