**Guiding Question:** Do people understand, trust, and act on this work?

The fourth imperative is where consulting becomes real. Your analysis only creates value if people understand it, believe it, and act on it. This is about communication, trust, and influence.

## Core Actions

### Craft a storyline that links insights to the decision **(6)** 🔺

*Toolkit: Clear Communication*

Don't just present findings—tell a story that leads logically to your recommendation.

| Recruiting Application | Client Work Application |
|:-----------------------|:------------------------|
| Behavioral stories: use PARADE to link your experience to role requirements | Slide storylines: build a narrative arc from situation through analysis to recommendation |

**The Pyramid Principle:**

Start with the answer, then support it with evidence.

```
         [Main Message]
              ↑
    [Key Point 1] [Key Point 2] [Key Point 3]
         ↑           ↑              ↑
    [Evidence]   [Evidence]    [Evidence]
```

**SCQA Structure:**

- **Situation**: Context the audience knows
- **Complication**: What changed or what's the tension?
- **Question**: What do we need to decide?
- **Answer**: Our recommendation

**PARADE Framework (for Behavioral Stories):**

- **P**roblem/Context: What was the situation?
- **A**ction: What did you specifically do?
- **R**esult: What was the outcome?
- **A**pplication: How does this relate to consulting?
- **D**ifferentiation: What made your approach unique?
- **E**vidence: Quantify where possible

### Communicate with clear logic, explicit trade-offs, and executive brevity **(7)** 🔺

*Toolkit: Clear Communication*

Executives are busy. Communicate with clarity and concision.

| Recruiting Application | Client Work Application |
|:-----------------------|:------------------------|
| Behavioral delivery: crisp, confident, 2-minute answers | Present recommendations concisely; lead with the answer, support with evidence |

**Executive Communication Principles:**

1. **Lead with the answer**: Don't build to your conclusion
2. **Use action titles**: Every slide title should state a conclusion
3. **One message per slide**: If you can't summarize it, split it
4. **Quantify**: "Significant growth" → "23% growth"
5. **Be explicit about trade-offs**: What are we giving up?

**Action Titles:**

| Weak Title | Action Title |
|:-----------|:-------------|
| "Market Analysis" | "Market is growing 8% annually, driven by premium segment" |
| "Financial Overview" | "Margins have declined 300bps due to rising input costs" |
| "Recommendations" | "Invest $10M in premium refresh to capture 15% market share" |

**The 30-Second Rule:**

If you were interrupted after 30 seconds, would they know your main point? Structure every communication so the answer comes first.

### Tailor messages to senior audiences and stakeholder concerns **(7)** 🔺

*Toolkit: Client Hands*

Different audiences need different messages. Know your stakeholders.

| Recruiting Application | Client Work Application |
|:-----------------------|:------------------------|
| Tailor your story to each firm's values and needs | Tailor presentations to what each stakeholder cares about |

**Stakeholder Mapping:**

| Stakeholder | What They Care About | Potential Concerns |
|:------------|:--------------------|:-------------------|
| CEO | Strategic direction, shareholder value | Will this work? What's the risk? |
| CFO | ROI, cost, financial impact | Can we afford this? What's the payback? |
| COO | Implementation, operations | Can we execute? What resources do we need? |
| Board | Governance, risk, long-term value | Is this the right bet? |

**Tailoring Principles:**

1. Know what each stakeholder cares about
2. Anticipate their questions and concerns
3. Frame recommendations in their terms
4. Address objections before they're raised

### Build trust by demonstrating judgment, reliability, and empathy

*Toolkit: Client Hands*

Trust is the foundation of influence. Without it, even perfect analysis fails.

| Recruiting Application | Client Work Application |
|:-----------------------|:------------------------|
| Fit interviews: demonstrate character, judgment, and cultural fit | Build trust through consistent delivery, honest communication, and genuine care for client success |

**Trust Equation (reminder):**

$$Trust = \frac{Credibility + Reliability + Intimacy}{Self\text{-}Orientation}$$

**Building Trust:**

| Component | How to Build It |
|:----------|:----------------|
| **Credibility** | Know your stuff; admit what you don't know |
| **Reliability** | Do what you say; meet deadlines; follow up |
| **Intimacy** | Listen; remember personal details; be human |
| **Low Self-Orientation** | Focus on their success, not your credit |

### Prewire stakeholders before formal presentations

*Toolkit: Client Hands*

Never surprise stakeholders in a meeting. Prewire your recommendations.

| Recruiting Application | Client Work Application |
|:-----------------------|:------------------------|
| Before asking for a referral, build the relationship | Before the steering committee, share findings with key stakeholders individually |

**Prewiring Principles:**

1. **Identify key stakeholders**: Who needs to be aligned?
2. **Meet individually**: Share findings, get reactions
3. **Incorporate feedback**: Adjust recommendations if needed
4. **Build support**: Convert skeptics before the room
5. **No surprises**: Everyone should know what's coming

### Navigate difficult conversations and deliver hard messages constructively

*Toolkit: Client Hands*

Sometimes you have to tell people things they don't want to hear.

| Recruiting Application | Client Work Application |
|:-----------------------|:------------------------|
| Handle difficult fit questions with poise | Deliver tough messages about performance, strategy, or organization |

**Yes-No-Yes Framework:**

1. **Yes**: Affirm their perspective or concern
2. **No**: Deliver the difficult message directly
3. **Yes**: Offer a path forward or positive framing

**Example:**

- "I understand you've invested heavily in this product line (Yes). The data shows it's not recovering—we recommend sunsetting it (No). This frees resources to invest in your highest-growth segments (Yes)."

### Coordinate effectively across team members to present a unified narrative

*Toolkit: Teamwork & Collaboration*

In consulting, you rarely present alone. Teams must be aligned.

| Recruiting Application | Client Work Application |
|:-----------------------|:------------------------|
| In group interviews or networking events, coordinate with peers | Present as a team with consistent messaging and smooth handoffs |

**Team Presentation Principles:**

1. **Align on the storyline**: Everyone knows the narrative
2. **Clear handoffs**: Who covers what
3. **Support each other**: No contradictions or surprises
4. **One voice**: Consistent framing and recommendations

### Actively solicit feedback and adjust

*Toolkit: Coachability*

The best consultants constantly improve through feedback.

| Recruiting Application | Client Work Application |
|:-----------------------|:------------------------|
| After mock interviews, ask for specific feedback and apply it | After presentations and deliverables, ask what could be better |

**Seeking Feedback:**

1. **Ask specifically**: "What's one thing I could improve?"
2. **Listen fully**: Don't defend or explain
3. **Thank them**: Feedback is a gift
4. **Apply it**: Show improvement next time

**Demonstrating Coachability:**

- Before/after examples show growth
- Rapid incorporation of feedback
- Asking for feedback (not waiting for it)
- Openness to being wrong

## Putting It Together

The Create Impact actions flow:

```
Craft Storyline → Communicate Clearly → Tailor to Stakeholders → Build Trust → Prewire → Handle Hard Conversations → Coordinate → Seek Feedback
```

This is where consulting becomes influence—and where careers are made.

## Practice This Week

1. **PARADE story**: Write one behavioral story using the PARADE framework
2. **Action titles**: Take 3 slide titles and rewrite them as action titles
3. **Prewiring exercise**: Plan how you would prewire a controversial recommendation
