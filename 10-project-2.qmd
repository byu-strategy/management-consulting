# Project 2: Competitive Benchmark

Building on your company diagnostic, this project adds a competitive dimension. You'll compare your target company against key competitors to identify relative strengths, weaknesses, and strategic implications.

## Project Overview

| Element | Details |
|---------|---------|
| **Deliverable** | 3-slide competitive benchmark |
| **Due** | Week 10 (Thursday) |
| **Format** | Individual |
| **Submission** | PowerPoint/PDF uploaded to Learning Suite |

## Why Benchmarking Matters

Strategy is relative. A company's performance and position only makes sense in context:

- Is 10% margin good? (Depends on the industry)
- Is 5% growth strong? (Depends on the market)
- Is the cost structure efficient? (Depends on peers)

Competitive benchmarking answers: **How does the company compare, and what does that mean for strategy?**

## Selecting Comparables

Choose 2-4 competitors for your comparison. Good comparables are:

- **Same industry** – Facing similar market dynamics
- **Similar business model** – Comparable operations
- **Data available** – Public companies with accessible financials

Consider including:

- **Direct competitors** – Firms competing for the same customers
- **Aspirational peers** – Best-in-class companies to learn from
- **Emerging threats** – New entrants or disruptors

## Benchmarking Dimensions

Depending on your company, compare across relevant dimensions:

### Financial Performance

| Metric | What It Shows |
|--------|---------------|
| Revenue growth | Market share dynamics |
| Profit margin | Pricing power, efficiency |
| Return on assets | Capital efficiency |
| Revenue per employee | Labor productivity |

### Strategic Position

| Dimension | What to Compare |
|-----------|----------------|
| Market share | Relative position |
| Geographic reach | Scale and presence |
| Product portfolio | Breadth vs. focus |
| Customer segments | Who they serve |

### Operational Metrics

| Metric | What It Shows |
|--------|---------------|
| Inventory turnover | Working capital efficiency |
| Customer acquisition cost | Marketing efficiency |
| NPS/Customer satisfaction | Brand strength |
| R&D intensity | Innovation investment |

Choose 4-6 metrics most relevant to your company's strategic challenges.

## 3-Slide Structure

### Slide 1: Competitive Landscape Overview

**Purpose:** Set the stage by showing who the key players are

**Content:**

- Brief description of the competitive set
- Key market dynamics
- Positioning map or framework showing relative positions

**Example title:** "Three types of players compete in the grocery market: national chains, regional grocers, and discount disruptors"

### Slide 2: Performance Comparison

**Purpose:** Show how your company compares on key metrics

**Content:**

- Comparison table or chart
- 4-6 key metrics
- Visual highlighting of relative strengths/weaknesses

**Example title:** "Target company leads on customer loyalty but trails peers on margin efficiency"

### Slide 3: Strategic Implications

**Purpose:** Draw conclusions about what the comparison means

**Content:**

- 2-3 key insights from the comparison
- What this means for the company's strategy
- Questions or areas for further analysis

**Example title:** "Margin gap suggests opportunity in supply chain optimization and private label expansion"

## Slide Design Principles

Apply what you learned about communication:

### Action Titles

Every slide has a headline that states the insight:

❌ "Financial Comparison"
✅ "Target company's margin lags industry average by 3 percentage points"

### Clean Exhibits

- One main chart or table per slide
- Clear labels and legends
- Highlight the key insight with color or callouts
- Remove chart junk

### Consistent Formatting

- Same fonts throughout
- Consistent color scheme
- Professional look

## Data Sources

For competitive benchmarking:

| Source | What You'll Get |
|--------|-----------------|
| 10-Ks and annual reports | Financial metrics, segment data |
| Industry databases | Market share, growth rates |
| Investor presentations | Strategic priorities, KPIs |
| Analyst reports | Industry context, forecasts |
| News and press | Recent developments |

## AI-Assisted Analysis

Use AI to help synthesize competitive data:

> "I'm comparing [Company X] against [Competitors A, B, C] in the [industry] market. Based on their financial data and public information, help me:
> 1. Identify the 4-5 most important metrics to compare
> 2. Summarize how each company performs on these metrics
> 3. Identify 2-3 key insights about Company X's competitive position
>
> Format as a comparison table where possible."

Then verify data and refine with your own analysis.

## Evaluation Criteria

| Criterion | Weight | Description |
|-----------|--------|-------------|
| **Insight Quality** | 35% | Are the comparative insights meaningful and strategic? |
| **Analysis Rigor** | 25% | Is the comparison methodologically sound with accurate data? |
| **Slide Quality** | 25% | Are slides clear, professional, and action-titled? |
| **Synthesis** | 15% | Do you draw implications from the comparison? |

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

| Mistake | How to Avoid |
|---------|--------------|
| Showing data without insight | Focus on what the comparison means |
| Too many metrics | Pick 4-6 that matter most |
| Inconsistent comparisons | Use same time period, same definition |
| Weak titles | Every slide needs an action title |
| No "so what" | Conclude with strategic implications |

## Timeline

| When | What |
|------|------|
| Week 9 | Select competitors, gather data |
| Week 10 Tuesday | Draft complete, bring for feedback |
| Week 10 Thursday | Final version due |

## Building on Project 1

This project should deepen your Project 1 analysis:

- Your diagnostic identified strategic challenges
- Competitive benchmarking shows how peers handle similar challenges
- Together, they build toward your value-add hypothesis (Project 3)

Think of these projects as building blocks toward your capstone proposal.
