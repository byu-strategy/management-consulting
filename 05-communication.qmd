# Clear Communication

Brilliant analysis means nothing if you can't communicate it effectively. Consultants are judged not just on the quality of their thinking, but on how clearly and persuasively they convey that thinking to clients and colleagues.

This chapter covers the frameworks that make consultant communication distinctive: structured, answer-first, and designed for busy executives.

## The Pyramid Principle

The Pyramid Principle, developed by Barbara Minto at McKinsey, is the foundation of consulting communication. The core idea is simple:

**Lead with the answer. Support with grouped arguments. Back up with evidence.**

```{mermaid}

    A[Main Answer/Recommendation] --> B[Supporting Point 1]
    A --> C[Supporting Point 2]
    A --> D[Supporting Point 3]
    B --> E[Evidence]
    B --> F[Evidence]
    C --> G[Evidence]
    C --> H[Evidence]
    D --> I[Evidence]
    D --> J[Evidence]
```

### Why Answer-First?

Executives are busy. They want to know your conclusion first, then decide how deep they want to go into the supporting logic. This is the opposite of how we're taught to write in school (build up to the conclusion).

**Academic style (bottom-up):**
> "We analyzed market data, interviewed 50 customers, and reviewed competitor pricing. Based on this research, we found that customers prioritize convenience over price. Given these findings, we recommend..."

**Consulting style (top-down):**
> "We recommend launching a same-day delivery option. This will capture the 40% of customers who prioritize convenience over price, at a 15% premium. Here's how we reached this conclusion..."

### The Pyramid Structure

Every pyramid has three levels:

1. **Governing Thought** – Your main message (the answer to the question)
2. **Key Line** – 2-4 supporting arguments (grouped logically)
3. **Support** – Evidence and analysis backing each argument

**Example:**

> **Governing Thought:** "We should enter the European market through acquisition rather than organic build."
>
> **Key Line:**
> - Speed: Acquisition gets us to market 2 years faster
> - Capability: Target company has regulatory expertise we lack
> - Risk: Lower execution risk given our limited international experience
>
> **Support:** Each point backed by data, analysis, case studies

### Vertical Relationships

Moving vertically in the pyramid should answer "why?" or "how?"

- From governing thought down: "Why should we acquire rather than build?" → "Because it's faster, we get capabilities, and it's lower risk"
- Each supporting point should answer "why?" or "how?" for the level above

### Horizontal Relationships

Points at the same level should be:

- **MECE** – Mutually exclusive, collectively exhaustive
- **Logically grouped** – Similar types of arguments together
- **Ordered logically** – By importance, chronology, or structure

## SCQA: Storyline Structure

While the Pyramid Principle tells you to lead with the answer, **SCQA** (Situation-Complication-Question-Answer) helps you structure the setup that leads to your answer. It's particularly useful for:

- Opening a presentation
- Framing a problem for stakeholders
- Creating narrative flow in a deck

### The SCQA Framework

| Element | Purpose | Example |
|---------|---------|---------|
| **Situation** | Establish the context everyone agrees on | "We've grown 15% annually for 5 years" |
| **Complication** | Introduce the tension or problem | "But margin has declined from 15% to 10%" |
| **Question** | State the key question this raises | "How can we restore margin while maintaining growth?" |
| **Answer** | Your recommendation/conclusion | "Focus on premium segments and exit low-margin products" |

### SCQA in Action

**Presentation opening:**

> *Situation:* "Our company has successfully grown revenue at 15% annually over the past five years, outpacing the market."
>
> *Complication:* "However, this growth has come at a cost—our operating margin has declined from 15% to 10%, and our stock price has underperformed peers by 20%."
>
> *Question:* "How can we restore profitability while maintaining our growth trajectory?"
>
> *Answer:* "We recommend a focused portfolio strategy: double down on our two highest-margin segments while exiting or restructuring the three lowest-margin product lines."

### Why SCQA Works

SCQA works because it:

1. **Creates buy-in** – The Situation establishes shared ground
2. **Creates tension** – The Complication makes the audience care
3. **Focuses attention** – The Question clarifies what we're solving
4. **Delivers payoff** – The Answer resolves the tension

## Slide Writing Mastery

Consultants communicate primarily through slides. A well-designed slide conveys its message in seconds and supports deeper discussion when needed.

### The Action Title

Every slide needs an **action title**—a complete sentence that states the "so what" of the slide. The title should:

- Be a complete sentence (subject + verb + object)
- State the insight, not describe the content
- Be 10 words or fewer

**Bad titles (describe content):**
- "Revenue by Region"
- "Customer Survey Results"
- "Competitive Analysis"

**Good titles (state insight):**
- "North America drives 80% of revenue growth"
- "Customers prioritize convenience over price 2:1"
- "Competitors are investing heavily in delivery"

### The Slide Body

The body of the slide should:

- **Support the title** – Every element proves or explains the action title
- **Be scannable** – Use bullets, not paragraphs
- **Include one exhibit** – Chart, table, or diagram that visualizes the key point
- **Avoid clutter** – If it doesn't support the title, remove it

### Exhibit Design Principles

Charts should:

- Have a clear message (stated in a subtitle if needed)
- Use appropriate chart type for the data
- Highlight the key insight (bold, color, callout)
- Remove chart junk (gridlines, 3D effects, unnecessary labels)

| Data Type | Best Chart |
|-----------|------------|
| Comparison | Bar chart |
| Trend over time | Line chart |
| Part of whole | Pie chart (only if 2-5 segments) |
| Distribution | Histogram |
| Correlation | Scatter plot |
| Process/flow | Diagram |

### Page Flow

A slide deck should flow logically from start to finish:

1. **Opening** – SCQA setup
2. **Analysis sections** – One section per key argument
3. **Recommendation** – Clear action items
4. **Next steps** – What happens after this meeting

Each slide should connect to the next with a logical transition. A reader should be able to follow the argument by reading only the action titles.

## Verbal Communication

Consultants need to communicate clearly in many formats beyond slides:

### The Elevator Pitch (30 Seconds)

Can you explain your finding in 30 seconds?

**Structure:**
> "The main thing you need to know is [governing thought]. This is based on [2-3 key points]. The implication is [so what]."

### The Stand-Up Update (60-90 Seconds)

Daily team check-ins require crisp updates:

> "On [topic], I'm [status]. The key finding so far is [insight]. Next, I'm going to [action]. One thing I need help with is [ask]."

### Written Communication

Emails and memos should also follow the Pyramid Principle:

**Bad email:**
> "Hi team, I wanted to follow up on the analysis we discussed. I've been looking at the data and found some interesting trends. The customer segments show different patterns, and I've attached my analysis. Let me know if you have questions."

**Good email:**
> "Hi team,
>
> **Bottom line:** We should prioritize Segment A for the pilot—they're 2x more likely to convert than Segment B.
>
> **Key findings:**
> - Segment A: 40% conversion rate, $500 avg order
> - Segment B: 20% conversion rate, $300 avg order
>
> **Next step:** Let's discuss in tomorrow's standup whether to proceed.
>
> Analysis attached if you want to dig deeper."

## Common Communication Pitfalls

| Pitfall | How to Avoid |
|---------|--------------|
| Burying the lead | Start with your answer, not your process |
| Data dump | Synthesize before presenting |
| Jargon | Use client's language, not consultant-speak |
| Too long | Edit ruthlessly; if in doubt, cut it |
| No "so what" | Every slide, every paragraph needs a point |
| Weak titles | Write action titles, not descriptions |

## Practice Exercise

Take one of the analyses you did for your target company. Create:

1. **A one-slide summary** with an action title, 3-4 supporting bullets, and one exhibit
2. **An SCQA opening** for a presentation on your finding
3. **A 30-second elevator pitch** of your key insight

Practice delivering the elevator pitch until you can do it smoothly without notes.
