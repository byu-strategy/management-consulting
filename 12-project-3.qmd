# Project 3: Value-Add Hypothesis

This project moves from diagnosis to prescription. Working with a partner, you'll develop a hypothesis for how a consulting firm could add value to your target company—the kind of "freemium" analysis that might initiate a client relationship.

## Project Overview

| Element | Details |
|---------|---------|
| **Deliverable** | 5-slide value-add hypothesis |
| **Due** | Week 12 (Thursday) |
| **Format** | Pairs |
| **Submission** | PowerPoint/PDF uploaded to Learning Suite |

## What is a Value-Add Hypothesis?

A value-add hypothesis answers: **What could a consulting firm help this company achieve, and why would it be worth their investment?**

This is the transition from "here's what's happening" (diagnostic) to "here's what we could do together" (proposal). It's the kind of analysis consultants use to:

- Initiate conversations with potential clients
- Demonstrate relevant expertise
- Propose specific engagement scopes

## Building on Projects 1 & 2

Your value-add hypothesis should leverage your earlier work:

| Project | What You Learned | How It Informs Project 3 |
|---------|-----------------|-------------------------|
| **Project 1** | Key strategic challenges | Which challenge to address |
| **Project 2** | Competitive position | Why the challenge matters relative to peers |
| **Project 3** | Value-add hypothesis | What consulting could help achieve |

## Developing Your Hypothesis

### Step 1: Select the Opportunity

From your diagnostic and benchmark, choose one strategic challenge where:

- The stakes are high for the company
- External expertise would accelerate progress
- There's a clear path to measurable impact

### Step 2: Define the Value at Stake

Quantify the opportunity:

- **Revenue impact** – What could be gained from market share, pricing, or growth?
- **Cost impact** – What could be saved through efficiency, optimization, or restructuring?
- **Risk mitigation** – What losses could be avoided?

Even rough estimates are valuable. Use your analytical skills from Chapter 6.

### Step 3: Outline the Approach

Describe how consulting engagement could address the challenge:

- **Key questions to answer** – What would the engagement investigate?
- **Analysis required** – What data and methods would be needed?
- **Potential recommendations** – What kind of output would be delivered?

### Step 4: Articulate the Why Now

Explain why this is the right time for the company to act:

- Market dynamics creating urgency
- Competitive threats demanding response
- Internal changes opening opportunity windows

## 5-Slide Structure

### Slide 1: Executive Summary

**Purpose:** Summarize the entire hypothesis in one slide

**Content:**

- Company and context (1-2 sentences)
- The opportunity (1-2 sentences)
- Proposed approach (1-2 sentences)
- Expected impact (quantified)

**Example title:** "Supply chain optimization could unlock $50M in annual savings for [Company]"

### Slide 2: The Strategic Challenge

**Purpose:** Frame the problem that creates the opportunity

**Content:**

- Key findings from your diagnostic
- How the competitive benchmark reinforces the urgency
- What's at stake if not addressed

**Example title:** "Rising input costs and competitor efficiency gains are squeezing margins"

### Slide 3: The Opportunity

**Purpose:** Quantify the value at stake

**Content:**

- Size of the opportunity (revenue, cost, or risk)
- How you estimated the value
- Comparison to peers or benchmarks

**Example title:** "Closing the margin gap with top-quartile peers represents $50M annual opportunity"

### Slide 4: Proposed Approach

**Purpose:** Outline how consulting would address the challenge

**Content:**

- Key questions the engagement would answer
- Analytical approach and methods
- Timeline and major phases

**Example title:** "4-phase diagnostic would identify quick wins and structural improvements"

### Slide 5: Why Now

**Purpose:** Create urgency and establish next steps

**Content:**

- Market dynamics creating time pressure
- Competitive moves requiring response
- Suggested next steps to explore further

**Example title:** "Competitor investments make the next 12 months critical for action"

## Working with a Partner

This is your first paired project. Here's how to collaborate effectively:

### Division of Labor

| Approach | Pros | Cons |
|----------|------|------|
| **Divide slides** | Clear ownership | May lack integration |
| **Draft together** | Consistent voice | More time-intensive |
| **One drafts, one edits** | Efficient | Unequal effort risk |

**Recommendation:** Develop the hypothesis together, divide initial drafting, then integrate and polish as a team.

### Partner Dynamics

- **Establish norms early** – How will you communicate? What are deadlines?
- **Play to strengths** – Who's stronger at quantitative analysis? Slide design?
- **Give feedback constructively** – Focus on the work, not the person
- **Share credit equally** – The final product is both of yours

### If Conflict Arises

Use what you've learned about consulting teamwork:

1. **Name the issue** – Be direct about what's not working
2. **Focus on the work** – Keep it about deliverables, not personalities
3. **Find a path forward** – What specific changes would help?
4. **Escalate if needed** – Talk to your TA if you can't resolve it

## AI-Assisted Hypothesis Development

Use AI to help synthesize your analysis:

> "Based on my analysis of [Company X], I've identified [strategic challenge] as a key opportunity. Help me:
> 1. Estimate the potential value at stake using reasonable assumptions
> 2. Outline what questions a consulting engagement would need to answer
> 3. Suggest a high-level approach and timeline
> 4. Identify why this would be urgent for the company to address now
>
> Here's what I know about the company: [key facts from Projects 1 & 2]"

Then validate assumptions and refine with your own judgment.

## Evaluation Criteria

| Criterion | Weight | Description |
|-----------|--------|-------------|
| **Hypothesis Quality** | 35% | Is the value-add hypothesis compelling and well-reasoned? |
| **Quantification** | 25% | Is the opportunity sized with reasonable assumptions? |
| **Slide Quality** | 20% | Are slides clear, professional, and action-titled? |
| **Integration** | 10% | Does the hypothesis build logically on Projects 1 & 2? |
| **Teamwork** | 10% | Did partners collaborate effectively? |

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

| Mistake | How to Avoid |
|---------|--------------|
| Generic opportunity | Be specific to this company's situation |
| No quantification | Even rough estimates add credibility |
| Unclear approach | Describe what the engagement would actually do |
| Weak urgency | Explain why now, not just why |
| Unbalanced partnership | Communicate early, divide work fairly |

## Timeline

| When | What |
|------|------|
| Week 11 | Form pairs, align on company and opportunity |
| Week 12 Tuesday | Draft complete, bring for workshop |
| Week 12 Thursday | Final version due |

## Preparing for the Capstone

This project sets you up for your final capstone:

- **Project 3** – Identifies the opportunity
- **Capstone** – Develops the full proposal (15-20 slides, deeper analysis, team of 3)

Think of Project 3 as your "proof of concept" before going deeper.

## Practice Exercise

1. **Brainstorm 3 potential opportunities** based on your Projects 1 and 2. Discuss with your partner and select the most compelling one.

2. **Size the opportunity** using a rough estimation approach. What assumptions are you making? How sensitive is the estimate?

3. **Draft your executive summary slide** first. If you can't summarize the hypothesis in one slide, you're not ready to build the rest.
