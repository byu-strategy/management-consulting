# Networking and Resume

Getting a consulting interview requires more than a strong resume—it requires relationships. This chapter covers how to network authentically, build trust, and create application materials that stand out.

## The Trust Equation

Before diving into networking tactics, understand what makes people want to help you. The **Trust Equation**, developed by David Maister, captures the components of trustworthiness:

$$
\text{Trust} = \frac{\text{Credibility} + \text{Reliability} + \text{Intimacy}}{\text{Self-Orientation}}
$$

Let's break this down:

### Credibility

> "I can trust what they say about the topic."

Credibility comes from:

- **Expertise** – Do you know what you're talking about?
- **Track record** – Have you demonstrated competence?
- **Credentials** – Do you have relevant qualifications?

**In networking:** Show you've done your homework. Demonstrate genuine understanding of the firm, the industry, or the person's work.

### Reliability

> "I can depend on them to do what they say."

Reliability comes from:

- **Consistency** – Do you follow through on commitments?
- **Responsiveness** – Do you reply promptly and professionally?
- **Predictability** – Can people count on you?

**In networking:** If you say you'll follow up, follow up. Send thank-you notes within 24 hours. Do what you commit to.

### Intimacy

> "I feel comfortable sharing information with them."

Intimacy comes from:

- **Empathy** – Do you understand the other person's perspective?
- **Discretion** – Can you be trusted with sensitive information?
- **Connection** – Is there genuine rapport?

**In networking:** Be genuinely curious about the other person. Share appropriately about yourself. Create real human connection, not just transactional exchange.

### Self-Orientation (The Denominator)

> "How much are they focused on themselves vs. me?"

Self-orientation is the trust killer. High self-orientation looks like:

- Only talking about yourself
- Asking for things without giving
- Transparently transactional behavior
- Not listening

**In networking:** Focus on the other person. Ask questions. Be helpful. The relationship should feel balanced, not extractive.

## The Networking Mindset

Effective networking isn't about collecting contacts—it's about building genuine relationships with people you find interesting and who might find you interesting too.

### Shift Your Frame

| Transactional Mindset | Relationship Mindset |
|----------------------|---------------------|
| "What can this person do for me?" | "What can I learn from this person?" |
| "How do I get a referral?" | "How do I build a genuine connection?" |
| "I need to impress them" | "I want to have a real conversation" |

### The Long Game

Networking isn't about getting a job next week. It's about building relationships that may help you throughout your career. People want to help people they like and trust—and that takes time.

## Building Your Network

### Start with Who You Know

Map your existing network:

- **BYU connections** – Professors, classmates, MCA members, alumni
- **Family and friends** – Who works in business? Who knows consultants?
- **Work experience** – Former colleagues, supervisors, clients
- **Extracurriculars** – Club members, volunteer organizations

### Expanding Your Network

To reach people you don't know:

1. **Alumni networks** – BYU alumni in consulting are often willing to help
2. **LinkedIn** – Professional connection requests with personalized notes
3. **Events** – MCA events, firm presentations, career fairs
4. **Warm introductions** – Ask existing contacts to connect you

### The Outreach Email

A good outreach email is:

- **Brief** – Respect their time (under 150 words)
- **Specific** – Why this person specifically?
- **Clear ask** – What do you want? (Usually a 20-minute call)
- **Easy to say yes** – Offer flexible timing

**Template:**

> Subject: BYU student seeking advice on consulting careers
>
> Hi [Name],
>
> I'm a sophomore at BYU studying [major], and I came across your profile while researching [firm]. I noticed you [specific observation—worked on healthcare, went to BYU, etc.].
>
> I'm exploring careers in management consulting and would love to learn from your experience. Would you have 20 minutes for a call in the next few weeks?
>
> I'm flexible on timing—happy to work around your schedule.
>
> Thank you,
> [Your name]
> [Phone] | [LinkedIn]

### The Coffee Chat

Coffee chats (or phone calls) are your chance to build connection and learn. Structure:

**First 5 minutes:** Build rapport

- Thank them for their time
- Brief background on yourself (30 seconds)
- Transition to learning about them

**Middle 15 minutes:** Learn about them

Ask open-ended questions:

- "What drew you to consulting originally?"
- "What's been most surprising about the job?"
- "What kind of work have you found most interesting?"
- "How would you describe the culture at [firm]?"
- "What advice would you give someone in my position?"

**Last 5 minutes:** Wrap up

- Ask if there's anyone else they'd recommend you speak with
- Confirm next steps if any
- Thank them genuinely

### After the Conversation

- **Send a thank-you note within 24 hours** – Reference something specific from the conversation
- **Add to your tracker** – Log the conversation and any follow-ups
- **Follow through on any commitments** – If you said you'd send something, send it
- **Stay in touch** – Check in periodically (not just when you need something)

## Your Networking Tracker

Maintain a spreadsheet tracking:

| Column | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| Name | Contact name |
| Firm | Company |
| Role | Title/level |
| Connection | How you're connected |
| Last contact | Date of last interaction |
| Notes | Key takeaways from conversations |
| Follow-up | What to do next |

Update this weekly. Your TA will review it during feedback sessions.

## The Consulting Resume

Your resume is often the first impression you make. In consulting, the bar is high—every bullet needs to demonstrate impact.

### Resume Format

- **One page** – No exceptions for undergrads
- **Clean, professional** – Standard fonts, consistent formatting
- **Reverse chronological** – Most recent first

### The Quantified Bullet Formula

Every bullet should follow this structure:

> **[Action verb] + [what you did] + [quantified scope] + [quantified impact]**

**Before (weak):**
> "Helped with marketing campaigns"

**After (strong):**
> "Led 3-person team to design digital marketing campaign, increasing website traffic by 45% and generating 200 qualified leads in 6 weeks"

### Resume Sections

**1. Header**

- Name, phone, email, LinkedIn
- No photo, no address needed

**2. Education**

- University, degree, graduation date
- GPA (if above 3.5)
- Relevant coursework (if applicable)
- Honors, scholarships

**3. Experience**

- 3-5 bullets per role, all quantified
- Focus on leadership, impact, problem-solving

**4. Leadership/Activities**

- Campus organizations, volunteer work
- Focus on leadership roles and impact

**5. Skills/Interests (optional)**

- Technical skills (Excel, SQL, Python)
- Languages
- Interests (keep professional)

### Common Resume Mistakes

| Mistake | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| Describing duties, not impact | Lead with results, not responsibilities |
| No quantification | Add numbers: revenue, %, time saved, team size |
| Too long | Cut ruthlessly; one page maximum |
| Typos | Proofread. Then proofread again. |
| Generic bullets | Specific achievements, not vague claims |

## Resume Workshop Process

1. **Draft V1** – Complete first draft with quantified bullets
2. **TA Review** – Detailed feedback from your TA
3. **Draft V2** – Incorporate feedback, polish formatting
4. **Peer Review** – Exchange with classmates for fresh eyes
5. **Final Version** – Interview-ready resume

## Your Development Plan

After your TA reviews your resume, you'll identify gaps—sections that need more development. Create a plan to fill these gaps:

**Example development plan:**

| Gap | Action | Timeline |
|-----|--------|----------|
| Limited leadership | Take on MCA committee role | This semester |
| No finance experience | Excel modeling certificate | Next 2 weeks |
| Weak GPA | Prioritize academics; retake key classes | Ongoing |

## Practice Exercise

1. **Calculate your Trust Equation** – For a recent networking interaction, rate yourself 1-10 on Credibility, Reliability, Intimacy, and Self-Orientation. What could you improve?

2. **Draft an outreach email** – Write an email to someone at one of your target firms. Have a partner critique it.

3. **Rewrite your resume bullets** – Take your top 3 experience bullets and rewrite them using the quantified formula. Share with your TA.
