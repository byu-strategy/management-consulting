# Structured Problem Solving

Structured problem solving is the foundation of consulting work. It's a disciplined, hypothesis-driven approach that breaks complex business challenges into smaller, logically arranged components. It guides rigorous analysis and leads to clear, actionable recommendations.

## The 7-Step Problem-Solving Process

While different authors summarize the approach in various ways, we present here a seven-step articulation inspired by McKinsey's methodology:

1. **Define the Problem** – Frame the problem clearly and narrowly; ensure alignment on the question you're solving.
2. **Disaggregate** – Break the problem into MECE components (Mutually Exclusive, Collectively Exhaustive).
3. **Prioritize** – Identify which branches of the issue tree are most important to analyze.
4. **Develop a Workplan** – Build a roadmap of what analyses will be done, by whom, and in what order.
5. **Perform Analysis** – Execute data gathering, modeling, and logic testing for each hypothesis or branch.
6. **Synthesize Findings** – Boil down the results into insights that answer the core question.
7. **Communicate Recommendations** – Use top-down communication (e.g. the Pyramid Principle) to present findings clearly and persuasively.

These steps are best understood as an iterative cycle, not a fixed sequence. New data or insights often prompt revisiting earlier stages to refine the problem definition, reprioritize issues, or update the workplan.

## Step 1: Define the Problem

The most common mistake in problem solving is solving the wrong problem. Before diving into analysis, ensure you and your stakeholders agree on:

- **What is the specific question we're trying to answer?**
- **What decisions will this analysis inform?**
- **What does success look like?**
- **What are the boundaries and constraints?**

A well-defined problem statement is:

- **Specific** – Not "improve the company" but "increase profit margin by 3 percentage points"
- **Actionable** – The answer should lead to a decision
- **Time-bound** – When does the decision need to be made?
- **Measurable** – You'll know if you've solved it

**Example:**

❌ Vague: "Our company is struggling"

✅ Specific: "Why has our operating margin declined from 15% to 10% over the past two years, and what are the top 3 levers to restore it within 18 months?"

## Step 2: Disaggregate (MECE)

Once the problem is clearly defined, the next step is to **break it into smaller parts** that can be tackled systematically. This is where the **MECE principle** comes in—**Mutually Exclusive, Collectively Exhaustive**—a cornerstone of structured problem solving.

MECE ensures that:

- Each subcomponent is **distinct** (no overlap), and
- Together they **cover the whole space** (no gaps).

### When MECE Is Easy

Suppose you're segmenting adult customers by age. A **MECE-compliant breakdown** might look like:

- 18–24
- 25–34
- 35–44
- 45+

These categories are:

- **Mutually Exclusive** – No overlap (a 25-year-old doesn't appear in two groups).
- **Collectively Exhaustive** – Every customer belongs to one and only one group.

Compare that to this flawed version:

- Under 25
- 25–35
- 35–50

This version has two key issues:

- **Not Mutually Exclusive** – A 25- or 35-year-old could fall into two groups.
- **Not Collectively Exhaustive** – Customers over 50 aren't accounted for.

### When MECE Is Hard

Now consider analyzing why employees leave a company. Reasons for leaving are often **overlapping, subjective, and hard to categorize cleanly**.

You might start with a messy list:

- Low pay, poor management, lack of career growth, burnout, work-life imbalance, culture misfit, relocation, health issues, retirement, lack of challenge, benefits dissatisfaction, family obligations

This list has **overlap** (burnout might be caused by poor management and work-life imbalance) and **no structure**.

Applying MECE as a guiding principle:

- **Compensation-related:** Low pay, benefits dissatisfaction
- **Work environment:** Poor management, culture misfit, work-life imbalance, burnout
- **Career factors:** Lack of career growth, lack of challenge
- **Personal/life factors:** Relocation, health issues, family obligations, retirement

This version isn't perfect, but it's more mutually exclusive, closer to collectively exhaustive, and easier to use for analysis.

> In practice, perfect MECE is rare. Real-world problems are messy. But striving for MECE uncovers overlaps, spots gaps, and structures your work with clarity.

### Issue Trees

An **issue tree** (or logic tree) is a visual tool that disaggregates a complex problem into its component parts. Each level should strive to be MECE.

**Example: Why are profits declining?**

```{mermaid}
graph TD
    A[Why are profits declining?] --> B[Revenue declining?]
    A --> C[Costs increasing?]
    B --> D[Price decreasing?]
    B --> E[Volume decreasing?]
    C --> F[Fixed costs increasing?]
    C --> G[Variable costs increasing?]
```

This tree:

- Breaks the top-level problem into two distinct branches: revenue and costs
- Further disaggregates those into logical, MECE subcomponents
- Provides a clear starting point for analysis and hypothesis generation

## Step 3: Prioritize (80/20)

Not all branches of your issue tree are equally important. The **80/20 principle** (Pareto principle) suggests that roughly 80% of the value comes from 20% of the effort—if you focus on the right things.

Prioritization means:

- **Identifying high-impact branches** – Which parts of the issue tree are most likely to explain the problem?
- **Estimating effort vs. value** – Which analyses will give you the most insight for the time invested?
- **Sequencing intelligently** – What needs to happen first to unlock later analyses?

**Example prioritization questions:**

- "If revenue is declining, is it more likely due to price or volume? Let's check volume first since that data is readily available."
- "Costs are increasing, but fixed costs have been stable. Let's focus on variable costs."

The goal is not to analyze everything—it's to analyze the right things.

## Step 4: Develop a Workplan

A workplan translates your prioritized issue tree into a concrete action plan:

| Analysis | Owner | Due | Data Needed | Output |
|----------|-------|-----|-------------|--------|
| Volume trends by segment | Analyst 1 | Day 2 | Sales data 2020-2024 | Waterfall chart |
| Competitor pricing analysis | Analyst 2 | Day 3 | Public pricing, industry reports | Comparison table |
| Variable cost breakdown | Analyst 1 | Day 4 | Cost accounting data | Pareto chart |

A good workplan:

- Maps each priority hypothesis to a specific analysis
- Assigns clear ownership and deadlines
- Specifies what data is needed and what output will be produced
- Builds in time for synthesis and iteration

## Step 5: Perform Analysis

This is where you execute the workplan—gather data, build models, test hypotheses. Key principles:

- **Start with the answer in mind** – What would convince you the hypothesis is true or false?
- **Be hypothesis-driven** – Don't just gather data; gather data to test specific hypotheses
- **Document your work** – Others should be able to understand and verify your analysis
- **Flag blockers early** – If you're stuck, escalate before you're behind

## Step 6: Synthesize Findings

Synthesis is the most valuable—and most difficult—step. It means distilling your analysis into **insights that answer the original question**.

**Bad synthesis (data dump):**
> "We analyzed revenue by segment, pricing trends, and cost structure. Here are 47 charts."

**Good synthesis (insight-driven):**
> "Profit margin declined primarily due to two factors: (1) volume loss in our core customer segment, driven by competitor entry, and (2) rising input costs that we failed to pass through in pricing. Together, these explain 85% of the margin decline."

Synthesis requires:

- **Connecting the dots** across analyses
- **Prioritizing what matters** for the decision
- **Having a point of view** on what the findings mean

## Step 7: Communicate Recommendations

The final step is presenting your findings in a way that drives action. This typically means:

- **Leading with the answer** (Pyramid Principle)
- **Structuring logically** (SCQA or similar)
- **Supporting with evidence** (data-backed)
- **Anticipating objections** (risks and mitigations)

We'll cover communication frameworks in detail in the next chapter.

## Hypothesis-Driven Thinking

Throughout this process, the key mental discipline is **hypothesis-driven thinking**:

1. **Start with a hypothesis** – "I believe the answer is X because of Y and Z"
2. **Identify what would need to be true** – "For this to be right, we'd need to see A, B, and C in the data"
3. **Test and refine** – "The data shows A and B but not C—let me revise my hypothesis"

This approach is faster and more rigorous than open-ended exploration. It focuses your analysis on what matters and helps you avoid "boiling the ocean."

**Example:**

> "My hypothesis is that profit margin declined due to rising material costs, not pricing erosion. If this is true, I should see: (1) stable or rising prices, (2) stable volume, and (3) increased material costs per unit. Let me test each."

## Common Pitfalls

| Pitfall | How to Avoid |
|---------|--------------|
| Solving the wrong problem | Invest time upfront in problem definition |
| Boiling the ocean | Use 80/20 to prioritize ruthlessly |
| Analysis paralysis | Be hypothesis-driven, not data-driven |
| Data dump communication | Synthesize before presenting |
| Not iterating | Revisit earlier steps when you learn new things |

## Practice Exercise

Take one of your target companies from Week 1. Define a specific problem statement for that company (something you could analyze with publicly available data), then:

1. Write a clear, specific problem statement
2. Build a MECE issue tree with at least 2 levels
3. Prioritize which 2-3 branches you would analyze first and why
4. Draft a hypothesis for each prioritized branch

Bring this to class for discussion.
