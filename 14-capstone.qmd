# Capstone: Deep-Dive Proposal

The capstone is your culminating project—a comprehensive consulting proposal that integrates everything you've learned. Working in teams of three, you'll deliver a 15-20 slide deck and present your findings to the class.

## Project Overview

| Element | Details |
|---------|---------|
| **Deliverable** | 15-20 slide consulting proposal + 10-minute presentation |
| **Due** | Week 13-14 (presentations in class) |
| **Format** | Teams of 3 |
| **Submission** | PowerPoint/PDF uploaded to Learning Suite |

## What Makes This Different

The capstone differs from earlier projects in scope and depth:

| Dimension | Projects 1-3 | Capstone |
|-----------|-------------|----------|
| **Depth** | Surface-level analysis | Deep investigation |
| **Scope** | Single angle | Multiple workstreams |
| **Team** | Individual or pairs | Team of 3 |
| **Deliverable** | 1-5 slides | 15-20 slides |
| **Format** | Written only | Written + presented |

This is your chance to demonstrate mastery of the complete consulting toolkit.

## Capstone Requirements

### Strategic Foundation

Your capstone must include:

1. **Clear problem definition** – What strategic challenge are you addressing?
2. **Hypothesis-driven approach** – What's your answer, and how did you test it?
3. **Evidence-based analysis** – Data, benchmarks, and logical reasoning
4. **Actionable recommendations** – Specific, implementable next steps
5. **Risk awareness** – What could go wrong and how to mitigate

### Analytical Rigor

Your analysis should demonstrate:

- **Quantification** – Sizing opportunities, estimating impacts
- **Comparison** – Benchmarking against peers, industry standards
- **Segmentation** – Breaking down the problem into components
- **Prioritization** – Identifying what matters most

### Communication Excellence

Your slides should reflect:

- **Action titles** – Every slide makes a point
- **Clean exhibits** – One insight per chart
- **Logical flow** – Pyramid Principle structure
- **Executive presence** – Ready for a senior audience

## Slide Structure

### Recommended 15-20 Slide Flow

| Section | Slides | Content |
|---------|--------|---------|
| **Executive Summary** | 1-2 | Key recommendation with supporting reasons |
| **Situation & Context** | 2-3 | Company overview, strategic position |
| **The Challenge** | 2-3 | Problem definition, why it matters |
| **Analysis** | 5-7 | Evidence supporting your recommendation |
| **Recommendations** | 3-4 | Specific actions with expected impact |
| **Implementation** | 2-3 | How to execute, timeline, risks |
| **Appendix** | As needed | Supporting data, detailed analyses |

### Section Details

#### Executive Summary (1-2 slides)

The partner reads this first and may only read this.

**Slide 1: The Recommendation**

> Title: "[Company] should [specific action] to [achieve outcome]"
>
> Content: 3-4 bullet reasons why, with key quantification

**Slide 2 (optional): Impact Summary**

> Title: "This initiative could deliver [$X] in [timeframe]"
>
> Content: High-level roadmap, key metrics

#### Situation & Context (2-3 slides)

Set the stage for readers who don't know the company.

- Company overview (what they do, key metrics)
- Strategic position (market share, competitive dynamics)
- Recent performance trends

#### The Challenge (2-3 slides)

Frame the problem you're solving.

- What's the strategic challenge?
- Why does it matter (stakes)?
- Why now (urgency)?

#### Analysis (5-7 slides)

This is the heart of your work. Show your evidence.

Each slide should:

- Make one clear point (action title)
- Support with data or logic
- Connect to the overall argument

**Types of analytical slides:**

- Financial analysis (trends, margins, ratios)
- Competitive comparison (benchmarks, positioning)
- Customer/market analysis (segments, needs)
- Operational analysis (processes, efficiency)
- Scenario modeling (what-if analysis)

#### Recommendations (3-4 slides)

Be specific about what the company should do.

- **Initiative 1** – What, why, expected impact
- **Initiative 2** – What, why, expected impact
- **Initiative 3** – What, why, expected impact

Prioritize: Which initiative creates the most value? Start there.

#### Implementation (2-3 slides)

Show that your recommendations are actionable.

- **Timeline** – Phases, milestones, quick wins
- **Resources** – What's needed to execute
- **Risks** – What could go wrong, mitigation
- **Next steps** – What should happen this week/month

## Team Dynamics

### Forming Your Team

Consider:

- **Complementary skills** – Mix of analytical, creative, presentation strengths
- **Target company alignment** – Teams often focus on one member's target company
- **Working style fit** – Similar expectations for effort, quality, timeline

### Dividing the Work

**Option 1: Divide by workstream**

Each person owns a section of the analysis. Integrate at the end.

**Option 2: Rotate roles**

One person leads research, one leads analysis, one leads slides. Switch for each phase.

**Option 3: Ensemble**

Work on everything together. Most time-intensive but most integrated.

**Recommendation:** Divide by workstream for efficiency, but meet frequently to integrate.

### Team Working Agreement

At the start, align on:

| Element | Questions to Answer |
|---------|-------------------|
| **Communication** | How often? What channel? |
| **Meetings** | When? How long? Who runs them? |
| **Deadlines** | Internal deadlines before final due date? |
| **Quality bar** | What does "good enough" look like? |
| **Conflict resolution** | How will we handle disagreements? |

### Managing Team Challenges

**If someone isn't pulling their weight:**

1. Talk to them directly first (use Yes-No-Yes)
2. Be specific about what you need
3. Escalate to TA if not resolved

**If you disagree on the recommendation:**

1. Argue the case with evidence
2. Make the best decision together
3. Commit to the team decision once made

**If integration is messy:**

1. Designate one "editor in chief"
2. Build the storyline before building slides
3. Review together before finalizing

## The Presentation

### Presentation Format

- **Time:** 10 minutes presenting + 5 minutes Q&A
- **Audience:** Class (simulate client executives)
- **Visual aids:** Your slide deck

### Presentation Tips

**Structure:**

- Open with the recommendation (don't build suspense)
- Walk through the logic
- End with clear next steps

**Delivery:**

- Know your slides cold
- Make eye contact
- Handle transitions smoothly between speakers
- Stay within time

**Q&A:**

- Listen fully before answering
- Be willing to say "I don't know, but here's how I'd find out"
- Don't get defensive

### Dividing Presentation Roles

With 10 minutes and 3 people:

| Speaker | Slides | Time |
|---------|--------|------|
| **Speaker 1** | Executive Summary, Context | ~3 min |
| **Speaker 2** | Analysis (main section) | ~4 min |
| **Speaker 3** | Recommendations, Implementation | ~3 min |

Practice transitions between speakers.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

| Mistake | How to Avoid |
|---------|--------------|
| Too broad | Pick one clear problem to solve |
| Data dump | Synthesize; every slide needs a "so what" |
| Vague recommendations | Be specific: who does what by when |
| Poor integration | Build storyline together, not separately |
| Presentation runs long | Practice, time yourself, cut ruthlessly |
| Not ready for Q&A | Anticipate questions; know your analysis cold |

## AI for Capstone Work

Use AI strategically for each phase:

**Research phase:**

> "Based on [company's] public filings and news, identify the 3 most pressing strategic challenges with specific evidence."

**Analysis phase:**

> "Help me structure an analysis to test whether [hypothesis]. What data would I need and what would strong evidence look like?"

**Synthesis phase:**

> "Here are my key findings: [list]. Help me distill this into 3 clear recommendations with supporting reasons."

**Slide drafting phase:**

> "I need to communicate [insight] in one slide. Draft an action title and suggest a visual format."

**Quality check:**

> "Review this executive summary for clarity and persuasiveness. What's missing? What's unclear?"

## Practice Exercise

1. **Develop your storyline** – Before building slides, write out the logic flow in 5-7 sentences. Does each point lead to the next?

2. **Conduct a peer review** – Exchange rough drafts with another team. Provide specific feedback using the evaluation criteria.

3. **Practice your presentation** – Record yourself delivering your section. Watch it back. What would you improve?

4. **Prepare for Q&A** – List 10 questions you might be asked. Prepare answers for each.
