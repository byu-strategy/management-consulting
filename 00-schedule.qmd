## TA Pod Schedule

Throughout the semester, you will meet with your TA for:

- **Goals Chat (Week 2)**: Meet with your TA for a 20-minute conversation to establish recruiting goals and development focus (due Sat Jan 24)
- **TA Interview and Mentoring 1 (Week 5)**: Baseline practice interview—behavioral + case (due Sat Feb 7)
- **TA Interview and Mentoring 2 (Week 9)**: Progress check practice interview—track growth (due Sat Mar 7)
- **TA Interview and Mentoring 3 (Week 14)**: Final practice interview evaluation (due Sat Apr 11)

Each TA Interview and Mentoring session is a full practice interview (~60 min) that includes a behavioral question followed by a case, mirroring the actual MBB interview format.

Before your first practice interview, [set up your feedback form](00-assessments.qmd#practice-interviews) so interviewers can submit evaluations.

---

## Practice Interview Schedule

Practice interviews combine behavioral and case components (~60 min each).

| Role | Sessions | Description |
|:-----|:--------:|:------------|
| **Interviewee** | 7 peer + 3 TA = **10** | You get interviewed |
| **Interviewer** | 7 peer = **7** | You conduct the interview |

Each "Peer" session in the schedule = swap roles with a partner (you interview them, they interview you). See the Daily Schedule for weekly milestones.
