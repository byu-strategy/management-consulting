## TA Pod Schedule

Throughout the semester, you will meet with your TA for:

- **Goals Worksheet + Chat (Week 2)**: Complete the Goals Worksheet, then meet with your TA for a 20-minute conversation to establish recruiting goals and development focus
- **TA Mentoring Session 1 (Week 5)**: Baseline practice interview—behavioral + case
- **TA Mentoring Session 2 (Week 9)**: Progress check practice interview—track growth
- **TA Mentoring Session 3 (Week 14)**: Final practice interview evaluation

Each TA Mentoring Session is a full practice interview (~60 min) that includes a behavioral question followed by a case, mirroring the actual MBB interview format.

Before your first practice interview, [set up your feedback form](00-assessments.qmd#practice-interview-log) so interviewers can submit evaluations.
