## Course Overview

Welcome to *Intro to Management Consulting* (STRAT 325). This course teaches you the **Consultant's OS**—the professional operating system that drives success at top-tier consulting firms and beyond.

You'll apply this OS to two course goals:

| Goal | Focus | Outcome |
|:-----|:------|:--------|
| **Land an Offer** | Networking, resume, case interviews, behavioral stories | Secure a consulting internship |
| **Build the Skills** | Company analysis, competitive benchmarking, strategic proposals | Deliver real consulting work |

These goals reinforce each other. The same OS that helps you structure a case interview helps you structure a client recommendation. The same approach that builds your networking skills builds trust with stakeholders.

### The Consultant Toolkit

By the end of this course, you will develop proficiency in eight core areas:

| Skill | What It Means |
|-------|--------------|
| **Structured Problem-Solving** | Decompose ambiguous problems using MECE logic and hypothesis-driven thinking |
| **Clear Communication** | Apply the Pyramid Principle; write action-titled slides; deliver crisp verbal updates |
| **Analytics & Modeling** | Build models in Excel; synthesize data into insights; estimate with confidence |
| **Workstream Ownership** | Manage analyses from start to finish; deliver quality work on deadline |
| **Client Hands** | Interact professionally with senior stakeholders; build trust through credibility |
| **Teamwork** | Collaborate across team structures; give and receive feedback effectively |
| **Coachability** | Incorporate feedback rapidly; demonstrate growth through iteration |
| **Tolerance for Ambiguity** | Navigate uncertainty; make progress without complete information |

### AI as Your Operating System

AI is not a separate topic—it's how you'll apply every skill in this course. From Week 2, you'll learn to use AI tools (Claude, VS Code/Cursor) to accelerate your research, analysis, and communication. Every project expects AI-assisted work.
