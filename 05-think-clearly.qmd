title: "1. Think Clearly"

**Guiding Question:** Are we solving the right problem in the right way?

The first imperative is about structuring your thinking before you start working. Most failed projects fail here: they solve the wrong problem, or solve the right problem in an unstructured way that leads nowhere.

## Core Actions

### 1.1 Diagnose the Current State **(0)** 🔺

*Understand what's happening and why*

Before defining a problem, you need to understand the current situation. What's actually happening? What are the symptoms? What might be causing them?

| Recruiting Application | Client Work Application |
|:-----------------------|:------------------------|
| Diagnose the firm's hiring needs: what do they look for? What gaps are they trying to fill? | Diagnose the company's strategic situation: what's happening with their performance, market, competitors? |
| Diagnose your current fit gaps: where are you strong vs. weak relative to what firms want? | Diagnose root causes: why is performance what it is? Don't stop at symptoms. |

**How to Diagnose:**

1. Gather observable facts (not opinions)
2. Look for patterns and anomalies
3. Ask "why" multiple times to get to root causes
4. Separate symptoms from underlying issues

### 1.2 Define the Problem **(1)** 🔺

*Identify the gap between current and desired state*

A problem is a gap between where you are and where you want to be. A well-defined problem is half-solved.

| Recruiting Application | Client Work Application |
|:-----------------------|:------------------------|
| Define the gap between "you now" and "hireable you": what specific capabilities or experiences do you need? | Define the client's problem: what's the gap between current performance and desired performance? |

**A Good Problem Statement:**

- Is specific (not vague)
- Is measurable (you know when it's solved)
- States the gap clearly
- Doesn't presuppose a solution

**Example:**

- ❌ "We need to grow"
- ✅ "Revenue has declined 15% over 2 years while the market grew 5%; we need to identify the root causes and develop a plan to return to market growth rates within 18 months"

### 1.3 Frame the Problem **(1)** 🔺

*Articulate the decision set, constraints, and scope*

Framing means establishing what's in scope vs. out, what success looks like, and what decisions are actually on the table.

| Recruiting Application | Client Work Application |
|:-----------------------|:------------------------|
| Frame your recruiting decision set: which firms are realistic targets? What's in vs. out of scope for this recruiting cycle? | Frame the client's decision: what are they actually deciding between? What are the constraints (time, budget, org politics)? |

**Framing Questions:**

- What decisions need to be made?
- What criteria will we use to decide?
- What's explicitly out of scope?
- What constraints must we work within?
- Who are the key stakeholders?

### 1.4 State a Day-1 Hypothesis 🔺

*Form a provisional view about which decision to make*

Don't wait until you have all the facts to form a view. State a hypothesis early, then test it.

| Recruiting Application | Client Work Application |
|:-----------------------|:------------------------|
| Hypothesize: "I'm the right hire because X, Y, Z." What's your core value proposition? | Hypothesize: "The company should do X because..." What's your initial answer to the client's question? |

**Why Hypothesize Early?**

- Focuses your research on what matters
- Makes your thinking explicit and testable
- Prevents "boiling the ocean" (analyzing everything)
- Allows you to iterate as you learn

### 1.5 Articulate "What Would Have to Be True" **(3)** 🔺

*Make your critical assumptions explicit and testable*

For your hypothesis to be right, certain things must be true. Make these explicit so you can test them.

| Recruiting Application | Client Work Application |
|:-----------------------|:------------------------|
| For "I'm the right hire," what must be true? (e.g., "My analytical skills are strong enough," "My story is compelling") | For "Company should do X," what must be true? (e.g., "Market is large enough," "Company has capabilities to execute") |

**WWHTBT Framework:**

1. State your hypothesis
2. Ask: "For this to be right, what would have to be true?"
3. List 3-5 critical conditions
4. Prioritize: which are most uncertain? Most impactful if wrong?
5. Design tests for the most critical ones

### 1.6 Disaggregate into MECE Issues **(2)** ◯ ◯

*Break hypotheses into non-overlapping, comprehensive components*

Break down your hypotheses into non-overlapping, comprehensive components.

| Recruiting Application | Client Work Application |
|:-----------------------|:------------------------|
| Structure your resume with MECE proof points: each bullet should be distinct and together they should cover your key strengths | Build a MECE issue tree: branches that don't overlap and together exhaust the problem space |

**MECE Explained:**

- **Mutually Exclusive**: No overlaps between categories
- **Collectively Exhaustive**: Nothing left out

**Common MECE Structures:**

- Revenue = Price × Volume
- Profit = Revenue - Costs
- Market = Segment A + Segment B + Segment C
- Options = Do nothing, Do X, Do Y

### 1.7 Prioritize by Decision Impact **(3)** ◯ ◯

*Focus on what would actually change the answer*

Not all issues are equal. Focus on what would change the decision.

| Recruiting Application | Client Work Application |
|:-----------------------|:------------------------|
| Prioritize which proof points to emphasize, leading with your strongest, most relevant evidence | Prioritize which hypotheses to test first, focusing on high-uncertainty, high-impact issues |

**Prioritization Criteria:**

- **Impact**: If this is wrong, does it change the answer?
- **Uncertainty**: How confident are we already?
- **Feasibility**: Can we actually test this?

### 1.8 Exclude Non-Decision Questions

*Know what NOT to analyze*

Equally important: know what NOT to analyze.

| Recruiting Application | Client Work Application |
|:-----------------------|:------------------------|
| Don't waste time on aspects of your background that don't matter for this role | Don't boil the ocean. Explicitly state what you're not analyzing and why |

**The "So What" Test:**

For any potential analysis, ask: "If we knew the answer, would it change our recommendation?" If no, skip it.

## Putting It Together

The Think Clearly actions flow naturally:

```
Diagnose → Define → Frame → Hypothesize → WWHTBT → Disaggregate → Prioritize → Exclude
```

In practice, you iterate. New information updates your hypothesis. Better framing changes your priorities. But you always start with structure.

## Practice This Week

1. **Problem definition exercise**: Take a challenge you're facing (academic, personal, career). Write a proper problem statement.
2. **Issue tree exercise**: Build a MECE issue tree for "How should I prepare for consulting recruiting?"
3. **WWHTBT exercise**: For your hypothesis "I can get a consulting offer," what would have to be true?
