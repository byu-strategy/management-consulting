# Mock Interview Resources

This appendix provides resources for case practice—sample cases, practice frameworks, and guidance for running effective mock sessions.

## Case Practice Requirements

Throughout the course, you'll complete structured case practice:

| Component | Timing | Format |
|-----------|--------|--------|
| **Case walkthrough** | Weeks 7-8 | Pod-based introduction with TA |
| **Pieces of a case** | Weeks 7-12 | 5 focused skill-building assignments |
| **Practice cases** | Ongoing | Peer-to-peer and TA sessions |
| **Casing midterm** | Week 10 | 2 full mock cases (different TAs) |
| **Casing final** | Week 15 | Rigorously graded evaluation |

## The "Pieces of a Case" Assignments

Before doing full cases, master the components:

### 1. Paper Frameworks

Practice building frameworks on paper without time pressure:

**Assignment:** Given a case prompt, write out your framework including:

- 3-4 buckets
- Key questions under each bucket
- Initial hypothesis
- Where you'd start and why

**Evaluation:**

- Is it MECE?
- Is it tailored to the specific case?
- Is the hypothesis reasonable?
- Is prioritization logical?

### 2. Quant Packet

Build fluency with case math:

**Assignment:** Complete a timed quantitative exercise including:

- Market sizing
- Profitability calculations
- Breakeven analysis
- Growth rate calculations

**Evaluation:**

- Accuracy
- Speed
- Structured approach
- Clear communication of work

### 3. Exhibit Interpretation

Practice extracting insights from data:

**Assignment:** Given 3-4 exhibits, write:

- The key insight from each exhibit
- How the exhibits connect
- What questions the data raises
- How you'd use this in a recommendation

**Evaluation:**

- Correct interpretation
- Synthesis across exhibits
- Insight beyond the obvious
- Connection to case context

### 4. Structured Brainstorm

Practice generating creative yet structured ideas:

**Assignment:** Given a strategic question, brainstorm solutions that are:

- MECE in organization
- Creative but feasible
- Prioritized by impact

**Evaluation:**

- Breadth of ideas
- Structure of presentation
- Quality of prioritization
- Practicality

### 5. Case Conclusion

Practice delivering crisp recommendations:

**Assignment:** Given case facts, deliver a 2-minute recommendation including:

- Lead with the answer
- 2-3 supporting reasons
- Key risk
- Next steps

**Evaluation:**

- Clear structure
- Evidence-based reasoning
- Appropriate caveats
- Actionable next steps

## Running Mock Interviews

### Structure of a Mock Session

**Total time:** 45-60 minutes

| Phase | Time | Activity |
|-------|------|----------|
| **Setup** | 2 min | Interviewer reads case |
| **Case intro** | 2-3 min | Present prompt, answer clarifying questions |
| **Structuring** | 3-5 min | Candidate builds framework |
| **Analysis** | 15-20 min | Work through case |
| **Recommendation** | 2-3 min | Candidate delivers synthesis |
| **Feedback** | 10-15 min | Structured debrief |

### The Feedback Conversation

After each mock case, provide feedback on:

**1. Problem Structuring**

- Was the framework MECE?
- Was it tailored to the case?
- Was there a clear hypothesis?
- Was prioritization logical?

**2. Analytical Skills**

- Was math accurate?
- Were calculations structured?
- Were insights drawn from data?
- Was there synthesis along the way?

**3. Communication**

- Was thinking shared out loud?
- Was structure used (numbering, signposting)?
- Was there periodic synthesis?
- Was the recommendation clear?

**4. Presence**

- Was there confidence without arrogance?
- Was there engagement with the interviewer?
- Were hints taken gracefully?
- Was composure maintained under pressure?

### Feedback Framework

Use this structure for feedback:

> **What worked well:** (2-3 specific things)
>
> **What to improve:** (1-2 specific things with how to fix)
>
> **Focus for next time:** (1 clear priority)

Be specific. "Your structure was good" is less helpful than "Your framework covered the key areas, but next time, state your hypothesis before diving in."

## Sample Case Prompts

### Profitability Case

**Prompt:**

> Our client is a mid-sized regional airline. Profits have declined 20% over the past two years despite stable passenger volumes. The CEO wants to understand why and what to do about it.

**Key information to reveal:**

- Revenue per passenger has declined 15%
- Fuel costs have increased 30%
- Competition from low-cost carriers has intensified
- Business travelers (high-yield) have declined 25%

**Expected approach:**

- Profit = Revenue - Costs
- Revenue decomposition: passengers × yield
- Cost decomposition: fixed vs. variable, major categories
- Root cause: yield decline from competition, cost pressure from fuel

### Market Entry Case

**Prompt:**

> Our client is a major coffee chain considering entering the Indian market. They want to know if they should enter and, if so, how.

**Key information to reveal:**

- India's coffee market is growing 8% annually
- Tea dominates but coffee consumption is rising, especially urban
- Local competitors are well-established
- Real estate costs in prime locations are high
- Middle-class consumer base is expanding rapidly

**Expected approach:**

- Market attractiveness: size, growth, trends
- Competitive landscape: who's there, how they compete
- Client capabilities: brand, supply chain, operations
- Entry strategy: organic vs. partnership vs. acquisition

### Growth Strategy Case

**Prompt:**

> Our client is a B2B software company that has grown 50% annually for 5 years. Growth has slowed to 15% this year. The board wants a plan to reignite growth.

**Key information to reveal:**

- Core market is maturing (60% penetration)
- Customer churn has increased from 5% to 12%
- New product launches have underperformed
- Sales team productivity has declined
- Two major competitors have emerged

**Expected approach:**

- Diagnose the slowdown: market, product, or execution?
- Organic options: retain more, sell more, expand products
- Inorganic options: acquisitions, partnerships
- Prioritization based on impact and feasibility

### Operations Case

**Prompt:**

> Our client operates 15 distribution centers across the country. They're experiencing rising costs and declining service levels. How should they improve operations?

**Key information to reveal:**

- 4 centers are underutilized (<50% capacity)
- 3 centers are over capacity (>95%)
- Transportation costs have increased 25%
- On-time delivery has fallen from 95% to 85%
- Labor costs vary significantly by region

**Expected approach:**

- Map current state: capacity, costs, service levels
- Identify root causes: network design, operations, labor
- Evaluate options: consolidation, expansion, optimization
- Quantify impact and recommend

### Pricing Case

**Prompt:**

> Our client makes industrial sensors. They haven't raised prices in 5 years and are considering a 15% increase. How should they think about this?

**Key information to reveal:**

- Costs have increased 20% over 5 years
- Competitors have raised prices 8-10%
- Customer switching costs are moderate
- Some customer segments are more price-sensitive
- Long-term contracts are common

**Expected approach:**

- Value-based pricing: what's the sensor worth to customers?
- Competitive pricing: where do we sit vs. alternatives?
- Cost-plus pricing: what do we need to maintain margin?
- Segmentation: different prices for different segments?
- Implementation: how to communicate and execute

## Case Math Practice

### Market Sizing

**Practice problem:** Estimate the annual market for baby strollers in the US.

**Approach:**

- US population: ~330M
- Birth rate: ~3.6M births/year
- % who buy new strollers: ~70%
- Average strollers per child: ~1.5
- Average price: ~$200

**Calculation:**

3.6M × 0.70 × 1.5 × $200 = $756M

### Profitability Math

**Practice problem:** A company has revenue of $100M and wants to increase profit margin from 10% to 15%. If they can't increase prices, how much do they need to cut costs?

**Approach:**

- Current profit: $100M × 10% = $10M
- Target profit: $100M × 15% = $15M
- Required improvement: $5M
- Current costs: $100M - $10M = $90M
- Cost reduction needed: $5M / $90M = 5.6%

### Breakeven Analysis

**Practice problem:** A new product has $2M in fixed costs, a selling price of $50, and variable costs of $30 per unit. How many units to break even?

**Approach:**

- Contribution margin = $50 - $30 = $20
- Breakeven units = $2M / $20 = 100,000 units

### Growth Rate

**Practice problem:** Revenue grew from $80M to $120M over 4 years. What's the compound annual growth rate?

**Approach:**

- Growth factor: $120M / $80M = 1.5
- Years: 4
- CAGR: 1.5^(1/4) - 1 ≈ 10.7%

| | | | | |

Review your log weekly. Are you seeing progress? What patterns emerge?

**Target:** 15-20 practice cases before your interviews, with increasing difficulty over time.
