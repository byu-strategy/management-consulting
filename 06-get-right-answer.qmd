**Guiding Question:** What do the facts and data actually say?

The second imperative is about finding truth. You've structured the problem, and now you need to answer it with evidence, not opinion.

## Core Actions

### 2.1 Design Hypothesis-Testing Analyses **(5)** 🔺

*Build analyses that will prove or disprove critical assumptions*

Don't just gather data. Design specific analyses that will prove or disprove your critical hypotheses.

| Recruiting Application | Client Work Application |
|:-----------------------|:------------------------|
| Design how you'll test your fit for each firm: what specific evidence will you gather? | Design analyses that directly test your "what would have to be true" conditions |

**Analysis Design Principles:**

1. **Start with the output**: What slide/exhibit will this create?
2. **Work backward**: What data do you need?
3. **Consider alternatives**: What would disconfirm your hypothesis?
4. **Be efficient**: What's the minimum analysis to decide?

### 2.2 Build an Outside-In Fact Base **(5)**

*Gather external data before relying on internal opinions*

Gather facts from external sources before relying on internal opinions. Public information reveals a lot.

| Recruiting Application | Client Work Application |
|:-----------------------|:------------------------|
| Research firms, roles, and people before outreach so you know who you're talking to | Build a fact base from filings, news, competitor data, industry reports |

**Outside-In Sources:**

| Source Type | Examples |
|:------------|:---------|
| **Financial** | 10-Ks, earnings transcripts, investor presentations |
| **News** | Press releases, trade publications, analyst coverage |
| **Competitive** | Competitor filings, industry reports, market research |
| **Expert** | Interviews, surveys, published interviews |
| **Digital** | Web traffic, social sentiment, job postings |

**The Trust Equation for Networking:**

When building relationships (a form of fact-gathering), remember:

$$Trust = \frac{Credibility + Reliability + Intimacy}{Self\text{-}Orientation}$$

- **Credibility**: Do you know what you're talking about?
- **Reliability**: Do you do what you say?
- **Intimacy**: Can they be vulnerable with you?
- **Self-Orientation**: Are you in it for you or them?

### 2.3 State Assumptions Explicitly **(5)** ◯ ◯

*Make your assumptions visible and find good proxies*

You never have perfect data. Make your assumptions explicit so others can evaluate them.

| Recruiting Application | Client Work Application |
|:-----------------------|:------------------------|
| When estimating in case interviews, state your assumptions clearly | Document all assumptions; find proxies when direct data isn't available |

**Assumption Best Practices:**

- State assumptions at the start of any analysis
- Distinguish facts from assumptions
- Use ranges when uncertain
- Identify which assumptions matter most (sensitivity)
- Find proxies: "We don't have X, but Y is a reasonable proxy because..."

### 2.4 Bound Answers with Quick Math **(5)**

*Establish reasonable ranges before building complex models*

Before building complex models, do quick math to establish reasonable ranges.

| Recruiting Application | Client Work Application |
|:-----------------------|:------------------------|
| Case interviews: market sizing, estimation problems | Bound the answer before diving deep: is this a $10M or $10B opportunity? |

**Market Sizing Framework:**

1. **Define what you're sizing**: Be specific
2. **Choose an approach**: Top-down or bottom-up
3. **Identify key drivers**: What factors determine the answer?
4. **Make explicit assumptions**: State them clearly
5. **Do the math**: Keep it simple, round numbers
6. **Sanity check**: Does the answer make sense?

**Example: Coffee Cups in Manhattan**

- Population of Manhattan: ~1.6M
- % who drink coffee: ~60% = ~1M coffee drinkers
- Cups per day: ~2 = ~2M cups/day
- Add commuters/tourists: +50% = ~3M cups/day

### 2.5 Build Models and Run Sensitivities **(5)** ◯ ◯

*Test how sensitive outcomes are to key assumptions*

When more rigor is needed, build structured models and test how sensitive outcomes are to key assumptions.

| Recruiting Application | Client Work Application |
|:-----------------------|:------------------------|
| Case interviews: more complex estimation requiring a structured model | Build Excel models; test which variables drive the answer |

**Model Building Principles:**

1. **Separate inputs, calculations, outputs**: Clear structure
2. **Label everything**: Units, sources, assumptions
3. **Build in flexibility**: Easy to change assumptions
4. **Highlight key drivers**: What moves the needle?
5. **Run sensitivities**: What if assumptions are wrong?

### 2.6 Synthesize into Clear Answers **(6)** 🔺

*Climb from data to insight to recommendation*

Analysis isn't done until you've answered the question. "So what?" is the most important question.

| Recruiting Application | Client Work Application |
|:-----------------------|:------------------------|
| Case interviews: drive to a clear recommendation with supporting logic | Synthesize research into "so what" insights that directly answer the client's question |

**Synthesis vs. Summary:**

| Summary | Synthesis |
|:--------|:----------|
| "We found X, Y, and Z" | "X, Y, and Z mean you should do A" |
| Lists facts | Draws conclusions |
| Describes | Recommends |

**The "So What" Ladder:**

1. **Data**: "Revenue declined 15%"
2. **Insight**: "Revenue declined because we lost share in the premium segment"
3. **Implication**: "We need to reinvest in premium or accept margin erosion"
4. **Recommendation**: "Invest $10M in premium product refresh"

Always climb to recommendations.

## Putting It Together

The Get to the Right Answer actions flow:

```
Design Analysis → Build Fact Base → State Assumptions → Estimate/Bound → Model → Synthesize
```

You often iterate: synthesis reveals gaps that require more analysis. But you always end with a clear answer.

## Practice This Week

1. **Market sizing**: Estimate the annual revenue of coffee shops within 1 mile of BYU campus
2. **Outside-in research**: Build a fact base on one of your target companies using only public sources
3. **Synthesis**: Take 3 facts you found and write a "so what" statement
