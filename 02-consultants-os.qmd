title: "The Consultant's OS"
---

*A professional operating system for solving problems, delivering work, and creating impact—in recruiting and in client engagements.*

## What is the Consultant's OS?

The Consultant's OS is the mental operating system that drives performance at top consulting firms. It's not a single framework—it's a complete way of thinking, working, and communicating that you can apply to any professional challenge.

This course teaches you the OS so you can:

1. **Land an offer** through networking, resume building, and interview preparation
2. **Deliver real impact** by building consulting proposals and pitch decks using outside-in analysis

The same OS that helps you structure a case interview helps you structure a client recommendation. The same approach that helps you network effectively helps you build trust with stakeholders.

## The Four Imperatives

The Consultant's OS is organized around four imperatives—fundamental questions that drive every piece of consulting work:

| Imperative | Guiding Question |
|:-----------|:-----------------|
| **Think Clearly** | Are we solving the right problem in the right way? |
| **Get to the Right Answer** | What do the facts and data actually say? |
| **Move Work Forward** | Is the work actually progressing toward a decision? |
| **Create Impact with People** | Do people understand, trust, and act on this work? |

Each imperative contains specific **core actions**—the concrete behaviors that consultants practice until they become automatic.

## The Eight Toolkit Components

As you practice the core actions, you develop eight interconnected skills that firms evaluate during recruiting:

| Component | What It Means |
|:----------|:--------------|
| **Structured Problem-Solving** | Decompose ambiguous problems using MECE logic and hypothesis-driven thinking |
| **Analytics & Modeling** | Build models in Excel; synthesize data into insights; estimate with confidence |
| **Clear Communication** | Apply the Pyramid Principle; write action-titled slides; deliver crisp verbal updates |
| **Workstream Ownership** | Manage analyses from start to finish; deliver quality work on deadline |
| **Tolerance for Ambiguity** | Navigate uncertainty; make progress without complete information |
| **Client Hands** | Interact professionally with senior stakeholders; build trust through credibility |
| **Teamwork & Collaboration** | Collaborate across team structures; give and receive feedback effectively |
| **Coachability** | Incorporate feedback rapidly; demonstrate growth through iteration |

These aren't separate skills to learn in isolation—they emerge naturally as you practice the core actions within each imperative.

## How This Course Uses the OS

Each chapter in "The Four Imperatives" section covers one imperative in depth:

- **Think Clearly**: Problem definition, framing, hypothesis development, MECE structures
- **Get to the Right Answer**: Research, estimation, analysis, synthesis
- **Move Work Forward**: Workplanning, execution, managing ambiguity
- **Create Impact with People**: Storylines, communication, stakeholder management, feedback

For each core action, you'll see how it applies to:

- **Recruiting**: How this action helps you land an offer
- **Client work**: How this action helps you deliver impact

## The McKinsey 7-Step Problem-Solving Process

The OS core actions align with McKinsey's classic 7-step process:

| Step | Description | OS Imperative |
|:----:|:------------|:--------------|
| 0 | Diagnose the current state | Think Clearly |
| 1 | Define the problem | Think Clearly |
| 2 | Structure the problem (MECE) | Think Clearly |
| 3 | Prioritize issues | Think Clearly |
| 4 | Plan the work | Move Work Forward |
| 5 | Conduct analyses | Get to the Right Answer |
| 6 | Synthesize findings | Get to the Right Answer / Create Impact |
| 7 | Communicate recommendations | Create Impact with People |

Throughout this course, core actions aligned to these steps are annotated with **(0)** through **(7)**.

## Your OS Starts Now

You don't wait until you're at a firm to start using the OS. You start now:

- **Structure your resume** using the same logic you'd use for a client recommendation
- **Research companies** for networking using the same outside-in approach you'd use for a diagnostic
- **Practice cases** using the same hypothesis-driven thinking you'd use on an engagement
- **Build your capstone** using the same storyline and communication principles you'd use for a steering committee

The OS is how you'll work for the rest of your career. This course is where you install it.
